# UI/UX Addon for Story 7.3: StrongLifts Data Import - Feedback, Saving & Conflict Handling

**Original Story Reference:** `ai/stories/epic7.7.3.story.md`

## 1. UI/UX Goal for this Story

## 2. Key Screens/Views Involved in this Story

- **Import Data Page (`ImportDataPage.tsx` or `StrongLiftsImportPage.tsx`):** This page, introduced in Story 7.1, will be enhanced to display dynamic feedback, progress, and a final summary.

## 3. Detailed UI Element Descriptions & Interactions for this Story

### 3.1. `ImportDataPage.tsx` Feedback Enhancements

- **In-Progress Feedback Area:**
  - **Element:** A dedicated section on the page that updates dynamically.
  - **Content during processing:**
    - `shadcn/ui Progress` bar component to show overall progress if feasible (e.g., based on file size or number of rows processed).
    - Textual status messages:
      - "Parsing file..."
      - "Validating data..."
      - "Checking for duplicate workouts..."
      - "Saving new exercises ([X] found)..."
      - "Saving workout logs ([Y] of [Total] processed)..."
- **Completion Summary Display:**
  - **Element:** Shown after the import process finishes.
  - **Content:**
    - **Success Message:** e.g., "Import Complete!"
    - **Summary Statistics:**
      - "Workouts Imported: [Number]"
      - "New Exercises Added: [Number]"
      - "Workouts Skipped (Duplicates): [Number]" (if applicable, as per AC4).
- **Error Reporting Area:**
  - **Element:** If errors occurred, display them clearly. Could be part of the summary or a separate section.
  - **Content:**
    - Overall error message: e.g., "[X] workouts could not be imported."
    - (Optional, if detailed logging is available) A brief list or summary of types of errors, e.g., "Issues found: Unrecognized date formats (2 workouts), Missing exercise names (1 workout)." Avoid overwhelming the user with individual row errors unless there's a "View Details" option.
- **Call to Action After Import:**

  - Button: "View Imported Workouts" (navigates to Workout History - Story 6.3).
  - Button: "Import Another File" or "Done" (navigates back to Settings or a relevant previous screen).

  - `{Figma_Frame_URL_for_ImportDataPage_Completion_Summary_WithErrors}`

## 4. Accessibility Notes for this Story

- Progress bar updates should be announced by assistive technologies if possible (e.g., using `aria-live` regions or `aria-valuenow` on the progress bar).
- Status messages and error reports must be clear, concise, and easily readable.
- Ensure good contrast for all feedback text.
