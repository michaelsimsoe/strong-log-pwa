# UI/UX Addon for Story 4.5: Adaptive Scheduling Logic & Display

**Original Story Reference:** `ai/stories/4.5.story.md`

## 1. UI/UX Goal for this Story

To provide users with a clear and adaptive view of their upcoming projected workout schedule for active programs, allowing them to see how their actual training rhythm influences future suggested dates.

## 2. Key Screens/Views Involved in this Story

- **UI Component for Displaying Program Schedule (e.g., `UpcomingProgramWorkouts.tsx` or `ProgramScheduleView.tsx`):** This component will display the schedule.
  - **Placement:** Could be part of the main Dashboard (Epic 6), within a dedicated "Program Details" page for an active program, or both.
- _(Core scheduling logic is in FRY worker; this story focuses on the UI consuming that logic's output)._

## 3. Detailed UI Element Descriptions & Interactions for this Story

### 3.1. Program Schedule Display Component

- **Layout:**
  - Typically a list or series of cards representing the next few upcoming workouts (e.g., next 1-3 as per AC3).
  - Could have a title like "Upcoming Workouts" or "[Program Name] Schedule".
- **Information Displayed per Upcoming Workout Item (`ProgramScheduleItem`):**
  - **Workout Identifier:** Name or tag of the workout session (e.g., "Workout A", "Leg Day", or `dayTag` from `ProgramWorkoutDefinitionEntry`).
  - **Projected Date:** The adaptively calculated date for this workout (e.g., "Mon, June 2", "Tomorrow", "In 2 days").
  - **Visual Cue for Adaptability:** A small note or icon indicating dates are "projected" or "subject to change based on your activity" could be useful to manage expectations.
- **"View Full Schedule" / "Go to Program" Link (Optional):** If displaying a summary, a link to a more detailed program view or full calendar might be provided.
- **Data Source:** Fetches an array of `ProgramScheduleItem` (or similar structure) from the FRY worker's `getProgramScheduleView` method via Comlink.
- **Reactivity:** The displayed schedule should update when the underlying program state changes (e.g., after a workout is logged and `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` is updated). This could be triggered by re-fetching from FRY worker when relevant views become active or data changes.

  - `{Figma_Frame_URL_for_ProgramDetail_ScheduleView_Component}`
  - `{Figma_Frame_URL_for_Single_UpcomingWorkoutItem_Display}`

## 4. Accessibility Notes for this Story

- Projected dates and workout names must be clearly readable.
  - Use unambiguous date formatting.
- If the schedule is a list, it should be navigable by keyboard.
- Any visual cues for adaptability should have accessible text descriptions if not inherently clear.

## 5. User Flow Snippet (Viewing Adaptive Schedule)

```mermaid

    A[User navigates to Dashboard or Program Detail screen] --> B[UI component fetches schedule from FRY worker `getProgramScheduleView`];
    B --> C{Schedule data received list of upcoming workouts with projected dates};
    C --> D[UI component renders the list of upcoming workouts];
    D --> E[User sees 'Workout A - Projected: Tomorrow'];
    E --> F[User sees 'Workout B - Projected: In 3 days'];

    %% Later, after user completes Workout A earlier/later than projected
    G[User completes Workout A, program state updates] --> H[User revisits Dashboard/Program Detail];
    H --> I[UI component re-fetches schedule from FRY worker];
    I --> J[FRY worker calculates new adaptive schedule based on Workout A's actual completion];
    J --> K[UI component renders updated list];
    K --> L[User sees 'Workout B - Projected: new adapted date'];
