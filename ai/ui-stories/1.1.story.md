# UI/UX Addon for Story 1.1: PWA Initialization and Installability

**Original Story Reference:** `ai/stories/epic1.1.1.story.md`

## 1. UI/UX Goal for this Story

To ensure the application shell is established correctly, providing a native-like PWA experience, including installability prompts and basic UI for global error handling. While much of this story is technical setup, the user-facing aspects are crucial for a good first impression.

## 2. Key Screens/Views Involved in this Story

- **Application Shell / Main Layout:** This is not a specific screen but the overall framing UI.
  - _(Reference: General `docs/ui-ux-spec.md` for overall App Shell definition)_
- **PWA Install Prompt:** A browser-generated UI, but its trigger and presentation are influenced by the manifest and service worker setup.
- **Error Boundary Fallback UI:** A simple, user-friendly UI to display when a React component encounters an error.

## 3. Detailed UI Element Descriptions & Interactions for this Story

### 3.1. PWA Install Prompt ("Add to Home Screen")

- **Description:** A browser-native prompt that appears (on supported browsers/platforms) suggesting the user install the PWA.
- **Interaction:**
  - The prompt mechanism is largely browser-controlled.
  - The app's `manifest.json` (with appropriate name, icons, display mode) influences the appearance and behavior of this prompt and the installed app icon.

### 3.2. React Error Boundary Fallback UI

- **Description:** A simple, non-alarming UI that replaces a section of the application if a critical rendering error occurs in a component wrapped by an Error Boundary.
- **Visuals:**
  - Should be consistent with the app's overall minimal style.
  - Typically includes:
    - A brief, user-friendly message (e.g., "Oops! Something went wrong here.").
    - Optionally, a "Try again" or "Refresh" button if the error might be transient.
    - Avoid technical jargon.
- **Placement:** Implemented for main application sections (e.g., around major routes or page components).

## 4. Accessibility Notes for this Story

- **Error Boundary Fallback UI:**
  - Ensure the text has sufficient contrast.
  - If a "Refresh" button is included, it must be keyboard accessible.
  - The message should be clear and understandable.

## 5. User Flow Snippet

N/A for direct UI interaction flows within this story, as prompts are browser-native and error boundaries are reactive. The main user flow is: User encounters an error -> Fallback UI is displayed.
