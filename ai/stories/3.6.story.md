# Story 3.6: User Override & Feedback for Applied Progressions

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see what progressions the engine has automatically applied to my next workout, understand why, and have the ability to manually override these suggestions if I choose, so I remain in full control.

**Context:** This story focuses on the user-facing aspects of the Progression Rules Engine. It ensures transparency by showing users what changes FRX made, why, and provides them with the final say by allowing overrides or explicit application of suggestions.

## Detailed Requirements

* When a user views their next planned workout that has been adjusted (data sourced from Dexie.js, which FRX worker updated in Story 3.5):
  * Clearly indicate which parameters (weight, reps, sets) have been changed.
  * Provide accessible information explaining which rule(s) triggered the change (data from `AppliedProgressionLog` or linked to the adjustment stored in `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`).
* Users must be able to manually edit any auto-adjusted parameters before starting or even during the workout.
* If a "suggestion" (like deload) was stored by FRX (Story 3.5) and presented by the UI, the user should be able to "Apply" or "Dismiss" it. Applying it makes the actual change to the planned workout in Dexie.js.
* The system should maintain a history of progressions applied (which rules, what changes, whether it was a direct application or an accepted suggestion) for user review in the `AppliedProgressionLog` table. This log is populated by Story 3.5 and viewed here.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When viewing a planned workout (e.g., in program view or before starting it), auto-adjusted weights/reps (resulting from FRX actions stored in `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`) are visually distinct or annotated.
* AC2: User can easily access information explaining which progression rule caused an adjustment (e.g., by linking the adjustment to an entry in `AppliedProgressionLog`).
* AC3: User can manually edit any auto-adjusted target weight or reps for the upcoming workout before starting it.
* AC4: Manual overrides by the user are respected for the current workout session being logged.
* AC5: If a suggestion (e.g., deload) is presented from `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`, user can choose to "Apply" it (which updates the workout plan in Dexie.js) or "Dismiss" it.
* AC6: A historical log of applied progressions and suggestions is accessible to the user by querying and displaying `AppliedProgressionLog` entries.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/pages/ActiveWorkoutPage.tsx` (or workout planning/preview UI) to display adjustments, allow overrides, and handle suggestion application.
    * `src/features/rules/pages/ProgressionHistoryPage.tsx` (to display `AppliedProgressionLog`).
    * `src/features/rules/components/ProgressionLogListItem.tsx`.
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts` or `programService.ts` (to handle applying user-confirmed suggestions to planned workouts in Dexie.js).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. Data sources are `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` and `AppliedProgressionLog` from `docs/data-models.md`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Tooltip`, `Badge`, `Button`, `Dialog`), Dexie.js, TypeScript.
  * `dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`) for reactive display of logs and adjusted plans.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API to read `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` and `AppliedProgressionLog`.
  * Dexie.js API to update planned workout parameters in `ActiveProgramInstance` (or other plan storage) when a user applies a suggestion.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` (read by UI).
  * `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` (read and displayed by UI).
  * Data model for the workout plan being displayed/edited.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * UI for displaying changes and reasons should be clear and non-intrusive.
  * Override mechanism should be straightforward.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI elements to visually indicate auto-adjusted parameters in the workout planning/preview screen (e.g., an icon, different color, tooltip).
* [ ] Implement logic to fetch and display the reason for change (e.g., rule name from `AppliedProgressionLog`) when a user inspects an adjusted parameter.
* [ ] Ensure that input fields for target parameters in the workout planning/active workout screen allow user edits, overriding any FRX-applied values for that session.
* [ ] Design and implement UI for presenting stored suggestions (e.g., "Suggested Deload: -10% on Squat") with "Apply" and "Dismiss" options.
* [ ] Implement the logic for "Apply Suggestion": when user clicks "Apply", update the corresponding planned workout parameters in Dexie.js (e.g., modify `ActiveProgramInstance` values that FRY uses). This might also update the related `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` to reflect user acceptance.
* [ ] Design and implement the UI for the Progression History page, displaying entries from the `AppliedProgressionLog` table using `useLiveQuery`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRX testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for displaying adjusted parameters, reasons, and suggestions.
  * Test components for progression history list items.
  * Test logic for applying/dismissing suggestions (mock service calls).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test fetching an adjusted workout plan (with data from `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` populated by a mocked FRX) and verify UI correctly displays adjustments and reasons.
  * Test applying a suggestion via UI and verify Dexie.js is updated.
  * Test reactive display of `AppliedProgressionLog`.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Full flow: Trigger a rule (Story 3.4/3.5) -> View next workout plan -> Verify adjustments are shown with reasons -> Override an adjustment -> Start workout, verify override is used.
  * Trigger a rule that creates a suggestion -> View suggestion in UI -> Apply suggestion -> Verify plan updates. -> Dismiss another suggestion.
  * View progression history page and verify entries.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRX testplan.md` for details)_
