# Story 3.2: Progression Rule Definition - Actions & Finalization

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a data-driven powerlifter, after defining conditions for my progression rule, I want to specify one or more actions the system should take when these conditions are met (like increasing weight or reps), and then save the complete rule.

**Context:** This story builds upon Story 3.1. Once conditions are defined, this story enables the user to specify the outcomes (actions) of the rule and save the entire rule definition to their library in Dexie.js.

## Detailed Requirements

* Continuing from Story 3.1, once conditions are set, the user must be able to define one or more actions for the rule.
* Supported actions must include (as per PRD FRX.1.4):
  * `Increase/Decrease Weight`: Specify exercise, amount (e.g., 2.5 kg, 5 lbs) or percentage to change for the next workout.
  * `Increase/Decrease Reps`: Specify exercise, number of reps to change for specific sets or all sets for the next workout.
  * `Hold Parameters Constant`: Specify exercise, maintain current weight/reps for the next workout.
  * `Suggest Deload`: Specify exercise, recommend a deload protocol.
* The UI should allow clear selection of the exercise the action applies to, the type of action, and its parameters.
* User must be able to save the complete rule (name, conditions, actions).
* The structure of defined rule actions (the 'event' part for `json-rules-engine`) must conform to a **Zod schema**.
* For actions confirmed as 'suggestion with option to apply' (Suggest Deload), the action parameters stored should define the specific suggestion clearly (e.g., deload percentage).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can add at least one action from the supported list (Increase/Decrease Weight/Reps, Hold, Suggest Deload) to the rule.
* AC2: For each action, user can specify relevant parameters (e.g., exercise, amount/percentage, target sets).
* AC3: User can save the fully defined progression rule (name, conditions from Story 3.1, actions), with actions validated by a Zod schema, to their library.
* AC4: The saved rule is persisted in IndexedDB (`progressionRules` table) with its JSON structure for `conditions` and `event` (actions) correctly stored as per `docs/data-models.md` and `docs/Progression Rules Engine (FRX).md`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/rules/pages/CreateRulePage.tsx` (extend from Story 3.1)
    * `src/features/rules/components/RuleActionBuilder.tsx`
    * `src/features/rules/components/ActionForm.tsx`
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `ProgressionRule` interface, specifically the `event` part for actions, and Zod schema are defined).
    * `src/services/data/ruleService.ts` (for saving `ProgressionRule` to Dexie.js).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`, `docs/Progression Rules Engine (FRX).md` for action/event structure)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Zod, TypeScript (as in Story 3.1).
  * Dexie.js (from Story 1.2).
  * `json-rules-engine` (concepts for event/action structure).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving `ProgressionRule` objects to the `progressionRules` table.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Rule `event` object compatible with `json-rules-engine` (containing `type` and `params` for actions).
  * Zod schema for the `event` (actions) part of the `ProgressionRule` data model.
  * Full `ProgressionRule` object as defined in `docs/data-models.md`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Save button should only be enabled when the rule (name, at least one condition, at least one action) is valid.
  * Store the entire rule, including conditions and event/actions, as a single `ProgressionRule` entry in Dexie.js.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for adding/configuring actions for a progression rule (extending the UI from Story 3.1).
* [ ] Define the data structure for storing rule actions as a JSON `event` object (`type` and `params`) compatible with `json-rules-engine`.
* [ ] Define a Zod schema for validating the structure of these rule actions/events.
* [ ] Implement UI components (`ActionForm.tsx`, `RuleActionBuilder.tsx`) allowing users to select exercises, action types, and specify parameters for actions.
* [ ] Implement client-side validation of the configured actions using the Zod schema.
* [ ] Implement logic for saving the complete `ProgressionRule` object (name, conditions from Story 3.1, and validated actions/event) to the `progressionRules` table in Dexie.js using a dedicated service (e.g., `src/services/data/ruleService.ts`).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRX testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `RuleActionBuilder.tsx` and `ActionForm.tsx` for UI interactions and state updates.
  * Test Zod schema for rule actions/events.
  * Test `ruleService.ts` for saving rules (mock Dexie.js calls).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test creating a full rule (conditions + actions) via UI and ensure it's correctly saved to Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Complete rule definition from Story 3.1, add various actions, save the rule. Verify it appears in the rule library (Story 3.3).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRX testplan.md` for details)_
