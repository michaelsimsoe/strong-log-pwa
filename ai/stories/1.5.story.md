# Story 1.5: Standard Workout Logging (Sets, Reps, Weight)

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log a workout session by selecting exercises and recording sets with weight and reps, so that I can track my basic training performance.

**Context:** This story implements the most fundamental feature of the app: logging a standard workout. It builds upon the exercise management and database setup from previous stories.

## Detailed Requirements

- Allow users to start a new, empty workout session.
- Users can add exercises (from their list populated in Story 1.4) to the current workout session.
- For each exercise in the session, users can log multiple sets, specifying `weight` and `reps` for each set (Standard Sets). Data should be validated using Zod schemas for `LoggedSet` and `WorkoutLog`.
- The interface should allow quick addition of sets and easy input of weight/reps, potentially using `shadcn/ui` form components.
- Users must be able to mark a workout session as "finished" or "completed".
- Completed workout sessions (including date, exercises, sets, reps, weight) must be saved to the `workoutLogs` and `loggedSets` stores in IndexedDB.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: User can start a new workout session.
- AC2: User can add one or more exercises from their exercise list to the current workout.
- AC3: For each added exercise, user can log at least one set with weight and reps, with data validated by Zod before attempting to save.
- AC4: User can easily add subsequent sets for an exercise, with fields potentially pre-filling from the previous set.
- AC5: User can complete the workout, and the entire session (date, exercises, and their sets/reps/weight) is saved to the `workoutLogs` and `loggedSets` Dexie.js stores.
- AC6: Saved workouts can be retrieved from history (basic retrieval for now, detailed view in Epic 6).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `src/features/logging/pages/ActiveWorkoutPage.tsx`
    - `src/features/logging/components/ExerciseLogCard.tsx`
    - `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx`
    - `src/features/logging/hooks/useActiveWorkout.ts` (or similar for managing active workout state, possibly with Zustand or local component state)
    - `src/services/data/workoutService.ts` (or similar for `WorkoutLog` and `LoggedSet` CRUD with Zod, using `db.ts`)
    - `src/components/shared/ExercisePicker.tsx` (if a global component for selecting exercises is made)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure & `docs/data-models.md` for `WorkoutLog` and `LoggedSet` details)_

- **Key Technologies:**

  - React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  - `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Input`, `Button`, `Card`, `Dialog` for exercise selection)
  - Dexie.js: (from Story 1.2)
  - Zod: (for `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet` schemas from Story 1.2)
  - TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Dexie.js API for creating `WorkoutLog` and `LoggedSet` records.
  - `shadcn/ui` components for forms, cards, and interactive elements.

- **Data Structures:**

  - `WorkoutLog` interface and Zod schema.
  - `LoggedSet` interface (specifically `StandardSet` variant) and Zod schema.
  - Local state structure for managing the currently active (in-progress) workout before it's saved.

- **Environment Variables:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Ensure all data for `WorkoutLog` and `LoggedSet` (especially user inputs for weight/reps) is validated by Zod before saving to Dexie.js.
  - Workout start/end times should be captured automatically. `durationMs` should be calculated.
  - Design for efficient set addition and data entry to provide a smooth logging experience.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Design UI for the active workout logging screen, including exercise selection, set input rows, and controls for adding/removing exercises/sets, and finishing the workout (using `shadcn/ui` components).
- [x] Implement state management for the in-progress workout (e.g., using a custom hook `useActiveWorkout` which might use React's `useState`/`useReducer` or a scoped Zustand store if complexity warrants).
- [x] Implement functionality to add exercises (from Story 1.4's exercise list) to the active workout.
- [x] Implement UI and logic for logging individual sets (weight, reps for `StandardSet`), including input validation (e.g., numeric, positive values) via Zod integrated into form handling.
- [x] Implement pre-filling of weight/reps from the previous set for quick entry of subsequent sets.
- [x] Implement functionality to mark the workout as "finished." This should trigger the saving process.
- [x] Develop service functions (e.g., in `src/services/data/workoutService.ts`) to save the completed `WorkoutLog` and its associated `LoggedSet` records to Dexie.js, ensuring all data is validated by their respective Zod schemas before writing.
- [x] Implement basic retrieval logic to confirm workouts are saved and can be listed (full history view is Epic 6).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  - Test `ActiveWorkoutPage`, `ExerciseLogCard`, `SetInputRow` components for rendering, user input handling, and interaction with state/service mocks.
  - Test `useActiveWorkout` hook logic (if implemented) for state transitions and data handling.
  - Test `workoutService.ts` functions: Mock Dexie.js and Zod to test workout saving logic, validation, and error handling.
- **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  - Test the full flow of starting a workout, adding exercises, logging multiple sets for each, and finishing the workout, verifying data is correctly structured and saved to Dexie.js (using a real Dexie instance).
  - Verify Zod validation prevents saving of invalid set/workout data.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - User journey: Start a new workout -> Add 2-3 exercises -> Log 2-3 sets for each exercise with specific weight/reps -> Finish workout.
  - Verify that after finishing, the workout can be found (e.g., if a history list is part of basic retrieval or by inspecting DB via Playwright if feasible).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Inspect IndexedDB to confirm `workoutLogs` and `loggedSets` are created with correct data and relationships.
  - Test various input scenarios for set logging.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
