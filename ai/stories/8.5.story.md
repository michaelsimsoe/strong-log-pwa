# Story 8.5: Creation of Basic User-Facing Documentation (with GDPR focus)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to basic help information, a Privacy Policy (detailing data handling under GDPR), and Terms of Service, so I can understand how to use complex features and how my data is handled.

**Context:** This story focuses on creating essential user-facing legal and help documentation to build trust, ensure compliance (GDPR), and assist users in understanding the application.

## Detailed Requirements

* **Privacy Policy:** Create a clear, concise, and GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy. It must clearly articulate how user data is handled for both anonymous local storage (IndexedDB) and for the optional cloud synchronization feature (if user opts-in), including data types collected, purpose, data retention, user rights under GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, portability), and contact information.
* **Terms of Service:** Create basic Terms of Service (ToS) for using the StrongLog PWA, outlining user responsibilities, app limitations, intellectual property, etc.
* **Basic In-App Help/FAQ:**
  * Provide simple explanations or tooltips for more complex features like setting up Progression Rules (Epic 3) or Programs (Epic 4).
  * Optionally, a small, searchable FAQ section answering common questions about app usage or features.
* Make these documents easily accessible from within the app (e.g., via a dedicated "About" or "Legal" section in Settings).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: A Privacy Policy document, addressing local (IndexedDB) and optional cloud data handling in line with GDPR principles, is drafted, reviewed (ideally by someone with GDPR knowledge), and accessible as static content within the app.
* AC2: A Terms of Service document is drafted, reviewed, and accessible as static content within the app.
* AC3: Basic in-app help content (e.g., tooltips integrated into complex UI sections like rule/program creation, or a simple FAQ page) is available to users.
* AC4: Users can easily navigate to and view the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service from within the application's settings menu.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create:
    * `public/legal/privacy-policy.html` (or markdown rendered into a component)
    * `public/legal/terms-of-service.html` (or markdown rendered into a component)
    * `src/features/help/pages/FaqPage.tsx` (if implementing FAQ page)
    * `src/features/help/components/TooltipExplanation.tsx` (reusable tooltip component)
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/settings/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` (to link to these documents).
    * UI components for FRX/FRY definition screens (to integrate tooltips).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. Legal documents might be static or rendered via React components.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, TypeScript (for rendering content if not static HTML).
  * `shadcn/ui` (`Tooltip`, components for displaying static pages).
  * Markdown (optional, if documents are written in Markdown and then converted to HTML or rendered).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * N/A. Focuses on content creation and display.

* **Data Structures:**
  * N/A for data models. Content will be text.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Legal documents should be presented in a readable format.
  * In-app help should be concise and contextually relevant.
  * "May require legal review" is a note for the Product Owner/Stakeholder, not an action for the dev agent. The agent will draft based on requirements.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Draft Privacy Policy Content:** Based on `docs/prd.md` (client-first, IndexedDB primary, optional sync), `docs/data-models.md` (what's stored), and GDPR principles (data types, purpose, user rights: access, rectification, erasure - linked to Story 7.8, portability - linked to Story 7.5). Clearly distinguish between local-only data and optionally synced data.
* [ ] **Draft Terms of Service Content:** Cover basic usage terms, limitations of liability, IP.
* [ ] Identify key areas in the UI (e.g., Progression Rule creation, Program Definition) that would benefit from in-app help tooltips or short explanations. Write this content.
* [ ] (Optional) Draft content for a small FAQ page answering anticipated common user questions.
* [ ] Implement UI components to display the static Privacy Policy and Terms of Service content (e.g., a simple page that loads and renders HTML or Markdown).
* [ ] Add links to these documents in the Settings screen (from Story 8.1).
* [ ] Integrate tooltips or brief help texts into the UI for complex features (e.g., using `shadcn/ui Tooltip`).
* [ ] If implementing an FAQ page, create the page and its content.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test components responsible for displaying static documents or FAQ content (if applicable).
  * Test tooltip components for correct rendering.
* **Manual Testing:**
  * Review drafted Privacy Policy and ToS content for clarity, accuracy regarding app features, and coverage of GDPR points.
  * Verify all links to legal documents and help sections work correctly.
  * Check readability and formatting of displayed documents.
  * Verify tooltips appear correctly and provide useful information.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Navigate to Settings -> Click Privacy Policy link -> Verify policy content is displayed.
  * Navigate to Settings -> Click Terms of Service link -> Verify ToS content is displayed.
  * Interact with UI elements that should have tooltips and verify they appear.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Content review is key for this story.)_
