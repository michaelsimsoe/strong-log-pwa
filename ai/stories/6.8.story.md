# Story 6.8: Analytics - Progression Engine Insights Display

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user whose training is guided by the Progression Engine, I want to be able to review a summary or log of the progressions that have been applied, so I understand how my plan is evolving.

**Context:** This story provides transparency into the FRX engine's operations by allowing users to see a history of automated progressions. It uses data from the `AppliedProgressionLog` table created in Epic 3.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a view where users can see a history or log of progressions applied by the Progression Engine (FRX).
* This view will query and display data from the `AppliedProgressionLog` table in Dexie.js.
* This could be filterable by exercise or program.
* Information should include which rule was triggered, what change was made (e.g., "+2.5kg to Bench Press"), and when.
* Data displayed will be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can access a view displaying a historical log of automated progressions from `AppliedProgressionLog`, fetched reactively using `useLiveQuery`.
* AC2: The log clearly shows the date, affected exercise (if applicable), the name of the rule triggered (from `AppliedProgressionLogEntry.ruleName`), and a human-readable description of the adjustment made (from `AppliedProgressionLogEntry.changeDescription`).
* AC3: User can filter this progression log, at least by exercise. Filtering by program might require linking `AppliedProgressionLogEntry.programInstanceId` to `ProgramDefinition` name.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/analytics/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx` (add progression insights section).
    * `src/features/analytics/components/ProgressionLogView.tsx`.
    * `src/features/analytics/components/ProgressionLogItem.tsx`.
    * `src/features/analytics/components/ProgressionLogFilters.tsx`.
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (`AppliedProgressionLogEntry`).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. Data is from `AppliedProgressionLog` table, populated by FRX in Epic 3.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`, TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` records from Dexie.js.
  * Dexie.js querying for filtering (e.g., `appliedProgressionLog.where('exerciseDefinitionId').equals(...)`).

* **Data Structures:**
  * `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Ensure efficient querying and display, especially if the log becomes long.
  * `changeDescription` in `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` should be human-readable.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for displaying the progression log, including list items and filter controls (exercise, program if feasible).
* [ ] Implement `useLiveQuery` hook to fetch `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` data from Dexie.js, with capabilities for filtering by `exerciseDefinitionId` and potentially `programInstanceId`.
* [ ] Implement `ProgressionLogItem.tsx` to display individual log entries clearly (date, rule name, exercise affected, change made).
* [ ] Implement `ProgressionLogFilters.tsx` to allow users to select filters.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRX testplan.md` (as it relates to FRX outputs).

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `ProgressionLogItem.tsx` and `ProgressionLogFilters.tsx` with mocked data.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Seed Dexie.js with `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` data. Test that `ProgressionLogView.tsx` correctly fetches (via `useLiveQuery`) and displays this data, including filtering.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * After FRX applies progressions (Epic 3):
    * Navigate to progression insights/log.
    * Verify the applied progressions are listed correctly with accurate details.
    * Test filtering the log by exercise.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
