# Story 2.6: Integrated Workout Timer (Countdown & Stopwatch)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user actively logging a workout, I want a highly accurate, versatile, and extremely user-friendly integrated timer that can function as both a countdown timer (for timed sets like AMRAP for Time, and for rest periods) and a stopwatch (for 'Reps for Time' sets), so I can precisely manage all timed aspects of my training session.

**Context:** This story details the implementation of a crucial utility: the Integrated Workout Timer. It will be used across various logging scenarios, including timed sets (Stories 2.2, 2.3), rest periods between standard sets, and rests within complex sets like Pyramids (Story 2.4) and Drop Sets (Story 2.5). This is a foundational UI component for advanced logging.

## Detailed Requirements

* **Dual Mode Functionality:** Countdown and Stopwatch modes.
* **Accuracy:** As accurate as PWA platform allows (e.g., using `performance.now()` or reliable `Date` object calculations, being mindful of `setInterval`/`setTimeout` inaccuracies for long durations if not compensated).
* **Resilience:** The timer's state (e.g., current countdown value, if it's running, mode) should be resilient to short app backgrounding events where feasible within PWA limitations (e.g., by storing start time and recalculating elapsed on resume), or clearly indicate its reset/paused state upon app resume.
* **User-Friendliness & Controls:**
  * Easy invocation (e.g., a button within the set logging UI).
  * Clear display of time (MM:SS format).
  * Simple controls: Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Reset.
  * Ability to easily adjust duration for countdown mode (e.g., +/- 5s, 15s, 30s buttons, or direct input).
  * Quick duration presets for rest periods (e.g., 30s, 60s, 90s, user's default).
* **Configuration:**
  * User-configurable default rest duration (from `UserSettings` - see Story 1.3 / 8.1).
  * Duration for timed sets (like AMRAP for Time) set via set parameters from Stories 2.2.
* **Notifications (Platform Permitting):**
  * Audible sound cue on countdown completion.
  * Vibration on countdown completion (if supported and enabled).
  * Visual indication (e.g., flashing display) on countdown completion.
* **Contextual Usage:** Designed to be invoked for rest periods, AMRAP for Time, and Reps for Time.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Timer component can be launched from the workout logging interface.
* AC2: Timer operates correctly in countdown mode with user-settable durations.
* AC3: Timer operates correctly in stopwatch (count-up) mode.
* AC4: Timer provides clear visual display of time and standard controls (Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Reset).
* AC5: Users can quickly select preset rest durations or their default rest time.
* AC6: On countdown completion, an audible and/or visual notification is triggered.
* AC7: Timer state (running/paused, current time) is handled gracefully during short app background/foreground transitions, maintaining accuracy or clearly resetting.
* AC8: The timer accurately measures time for both short and medium durations (e.g., up to 5-10 minutes).
* AC9: Default rest duration can be configured by the user (via UserSettings from Epic 1/8).

_(Note: AC10 from epic was about resilience, covered by AC7. Original ACs 1-9 were not in the provided epic text for 2.6, but derived from its detailed requirements for completeness)_

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create:
    * `src/features/logging/components/IntegratedWorkoutTimer.tsx` (the timer UI component).
    * `src/features/logging/hooks/useWorkoutTimer.ts` (custom hook for timer logic and state).
    * `src/assets/sounds/timer_alarm.mp3` (or similar, for audible notification).
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx` (or similar, to invoke the timer).
    * `src/state/uiStore.ts` or `userSettingsStore.ts` (to access default rest duration).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Button`, `Dialog` or `Popover` for timer UI)
  * Browser APIs: `AudioContext` / `<audio>` element for sound, `navigator.vibrate()` for haptics, `Date.now()` or `performance.now()` for accurate timekeeping, `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval`/`setTimeout` for ticks.
  * Zustand (to access default rest time from `userSettingsStore`).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Browser's timing mechanisms.
  * Browser's Web APIs for notifications (audio, vibration).

* **Data Structures:**
  * Timer state: `{ mode: 'countdown' | 'stopwatch', isActive: boolean, startTime: number, elapsedTime: number, duration: number, displayTime: string }`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Prioritize timer accuracy. Use `performance.now()` for elapsed time calculation if high precision is needed, otherwise `Date.now()` is often sufficient.
  * Handle visibility changes (`document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', ...)` ) to manage timer behavior when app is backgrounded/foregrounded to meet resilience requirements.
  * Encapsulate timer logic within a custom hook (`useWorkoutTimer.ts`) for reusability and separation of concerns.
  * Ensure notifications are user-configurable or follow platform best practices (e.g., respect silent mode).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design a user-friendly UI for the timer component, ensuring clear display and easy access to controls (Start, Stop, Pause, Reset, presets, duration adjustment).
* [ ] Implement the core timer logic in `useWorkoutTimer.ts` for both countdown and stopwatch modes. This includes managing `startTime`, calculating `elapsedTime` accurately, and formatting `displayTime`.
* [ ] Implement state management for the timer within the hook (running, paused, initial duration, etc.).
* [ ] Implement strategies for timer accuracy and resilience to PWA lifecycle events (backgrounding/resuming). For example, store `startTime` and `pauseTime` to correctly recalculate `elapsedTime` when resumed.
* [ ] Implement visual, audible, and (if platform permits) haptic notifications for countdown completion.
* [ ] Integrate the timer component into the set logging flow (e.g., `SetInputRow.tsx`) to be used for rest periods.
* [ ] Ensure the timer can be configured with a default rest duration from `UserSettings` (via Zustand store).
* [ ] Provide mechanisms for Stories 2.2 and 2.3 to pass specific durations or trigger specific modes for the timer.
* [ ] Conduct thorough testing of timer accuracy, controls, notifications, and behavior across different devices and PWA states (foreground, short background).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `useWorkoutTimer` hook: Verify logic for start, stop, pause, resume, reset in both modes. Test time calculation accuracy with mocked `Date.now()` / `performance.now()`. Test countdown completion and notification callbacks.
  * Test `IntegratedWorkoutTimer` component: Rendering of time, button interactions, calls to the hook. Mock notification APIs.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test interaction between the timer component and its usage context (e.g., a set logging component), ensuring durations are passed correctly and timer events are handled.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Difficult to precisely test timer accuracy in E2E, but can test:
    * Timer UI visibility and basic interactions (start/stop).
    * Timer starting with correct duration when used for a timed set (e.g., AMRAP for Time).
    * Rest timer starting with default or preset duration.
  * Manual E2E testing for notification behavior and resilience on actual devices is crucial.
* **Manual Testing:**
  * Critical for this story: Test accuracy on different devices/browsers. Test notifications (sound, vibration). Test resilience to app backgrounding/foregrounding for varying durations. Test usability of controls.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
