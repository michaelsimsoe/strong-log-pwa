# Story 6.9: Interactivity in Analytics Charts

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user viewing performance charts, I want to be able to interact with them, for instance by tapping a data point to see the underlying workout, so I can explore my data in more detail.

**Context:** This story enhances the analytics charts (from Stories 6.5, 6.6, 6.7) by adding interactivity, specifically allowing users to drill down from a chart data point to the source workout.

## Detailed Requirements

* Where feasible, performance trend charts (implemented with **Recharts** in Stories 6.5, 6.6, 6.7) should allow users to tap/click on a data point.
* Tapping a data point should provide more context or ideally link directly to the specific workout session or set that contributed to that data point (navigating to the detailed workout view from Story 6.4).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can tap/click on a data point in a time-series Recharts performance chart (e.g., e1RM trend, volume trend).
* AC2: Tapping a data point reveals contextual information (e.g., date, exact value, and ideally the name or ID of the source `WorkoutLog`).
* AC3: (If feasible for V1.0) Tapping the contextual information or the data point directly navigates the user to the detailed view of the `WorkoutLog` (Story 6.4) that generated that data point.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/analytics/charts/E1RMChart.tsx` (and other chart components from 6.5, 6.6, 6.7).
    * `src/services/analytics/*AnalyticsService.ts` (ensure data passed to charts includes identifiers like `workoutLogId` for each data point).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/features/history/pages/DetailedWorkoutViewPage.tsx` (target for navigation).
  * _(Hint: This involves modifying existing chart components from earlier in Epic 6.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Recharts: `~2.12.x` (specifically its event handling and tooltip/cursor customization features).
  * React, TypeScript.
  * React Router (or chosen navigation library) for navigating to detailed workout view.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Recharts event handlers (e.g., `onClick` for chart elements).
  * Navigation library's API to change views.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Data points passed to Recharts need to include the source `workoutLogId` (or enough info to retrieve it) to enable drill-down.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Ensure interactivity does not degrade chart performance.
  * Drill-down should be intuitive.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Investigate and identify the best way to handle click/tap events on data points within Recharts (e.g., using `onClick` props on chart series, custom active tooltips, or event listeners).
* [ ] Modify the data preparation logic in `*AnalyticsService.ts` (or worker) for charts created in Stories 6.5, 6.6, 6.7 to ensure each data point includes a reference to its source `workoutLogId`.
* [ ] Update the Recharts chart components (`E1RMChart.tsx`, etc.) to:
  * Attach event handlers to data points.
  * On event trigger (tap/click), display a tooltip or modal with contextual information (date, value, workout ID/name).
  * Implement navigation from this contextual display to the `DetailedWorkoutViewPage.tsx` (Story 6.4), passing the relevant `workoutLogId`.
* [ ] Test interactivity thoroughly on both desktop (click) and mobile (tap).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test Recharts components with mocked event handlers to verify that click/tap events are captured and attempt to trigger navigation or display context (mock navigation/context display).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * With data points that include `workoutLogId`, test that clicking a point correctly extracts this ID and initiates the (mocked) navigation process.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Navigate to an analytics chart with data.
  * Click/tap on various data points.
  * Verify contextual information appears.
  * Verify clicking the context (or data point) successfully navigates to the correct detailed workout view.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
