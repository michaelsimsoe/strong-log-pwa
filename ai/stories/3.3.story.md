# Story 3.3: Progression Rule Management (Rule Library)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view, edit, delete, clone, and activate/deactivate my saved progression rules in a personal library, so I can manage and refine my automated training logic.

**Context:** This story provides the user with a way to manage their library of created progression rules, enabling them to maintain and evolve their personalized automation strategies.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a dedicated section or screen where users can see a list of all their created progression rules.
* For each rule in the list, display its name and a summary of its core function or status (e.g., active/inactive).
* Users must be able to select a rule to:
  * `View` its full details (conditions and actions).
  * `Edit` its name, conditions, or actions (subject to Zod validation upon saving changes).
  * `Delete` the rule (with confirmation).
  * `Clone` (duplicate) an existing rule to use as a template for a new one.
  * `Activate/Deactivate` a rule (inactive rules will not be evaluated by the engine).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can access a list view of all their saved progression rules, fetched reactively from Dexie.js.
* AC2: User can select a rule and view its conditions and actions.
* AC3: User can edit an existing rule's name, conditions, and actions (reusing forms from 3.1/3.2), and save the Zod-validated changes.
* AC4: User can delete a rule from their library (with confirmation).
* AC5: User can clone an existing rule, creating a new, editable copy which is also saved to Dexie.js.
* AC6: User can toggle a rule between "active" and "inactive" states, and this status is persisted in Dexie.js.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/rules/pages/RuleLibraryPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/rules/components/RuleListItem.tsx`
    * `src/features/rules/pages/ViewRulePage.tsx` (could be part of EditRulePage from 3.1/3.2)
    * `src/services/data/ruleService.ts` (extend with update, delete, get all, get one rule functionalities).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Table` or list, `Button`, `Switch`, `AlertDialog`), Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript.
  * `dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`) for reactive list updates.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for CRUD operations on the `progressionRules` table.
  * `useLiveQuery` from `dexie-react-hooks` to reactively display the list of rules.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ProgressionRule` interface and Zod schema (from Story 3.2 and `docs/data-models.md`).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Ensure efficient querying of rules for the library view.
  * Use `useLiveQuery` for a reactive rule list.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the rule library page, showing a list of rules with their status and actions (View, Edit, Delete, Clone, Activate/Deactivate).
* [ ] Implement fetching and displaying the list of `ProgressionRule` objects from Dexie.js using `useLiveQuery`.
* [ ] Implement functionality to view details of a selected rule (potentially reusing parts of the creation UI in a read-only mode).
* [ ] Implement editing functionality, loading rule data into the forms from Story 3.1/3.2, and saving Zod-validated changes back to Dexie.js via `ruleService.ts`.
* [ ] Implement deletion of a rule, including a confirmation dialog (e.g., `shadcn/ui AlertDialog`).
* [ ] Implement cloning of a rule, which creates a new rule object (perhaps with " (Copy)" appended to name) and saves it to Dexie.js, then potentially navigates to edit it.
* [ ] Implement activate/deactivate functionality (e.g., using a `Switch` component from `shadcn/ui`), updating the `isActive` field of the `ProgressionRule` in Dexie.js.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRX testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `RuleLibraryPage` and `RuleListItem` components for correct rendering of rule data and interactions (e.g., button clicks call appropriate service functions).
  * Test `ruleService.ts` functions for update, delete, get operations (mock Dexie.js).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the full lifecycle: Create rules (from 3.2), see them listed, edit one, clone one, activate/deactivate, delete one, verifying Dexie.js state changes.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Create several rules. View library. Edit a rule. Clone a rule. Activate/Deactivate rules. Delete a rule. Verify changes persist and are reflected in UI.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRX testplan.md` for details)_
