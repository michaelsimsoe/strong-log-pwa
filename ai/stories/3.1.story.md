# Story 3.1: Progression Rule Definition - Conditions

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a data-driven powerlifter, I want to start defining a new progression rule by giving it a name and adding one or more conditions based on my previous workout performance, so that the rule can be triggered accurately.

**Context:** This story is the first step in creating the Progression Rules Engine (FRX). It focuses on the UI and logic for defining the conditional part of a progression rule. These conditions will be evaluated by the `json-rules-engine` in a web worker.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a UI section for creating new progression rules.
* User must be able to assign a unique `name` to each rule (e.g., "5x5 Linear Weight Add," "Reps Goal Met - Increase Weight").
* User must be able to add one or more conditions to a rule. Multiple conditions should be combinable (e.g., using AND logic initially; OR logic could be a future enhancement).
* Supported conditions must include (as per PRD FRX.1.3):
  * `Completion Status`: e.g., "All sets of Exercise X were completed as planned".
  * `Achieved Reps vs. Target`: e.g., "Achieved reps on last set of Exercise X >= Target reps".
  * `Specific Rep Count on Key Set`: e.g., "Reps on last AMRAP set of Exercise X > 8".
  * `Consecutive Successes/Failures`: e.g., "Exercise X successfully progressed (rule action applied) for the last 2 consecutive workouts," or "Failed to meet target reps for Exercise X for 2 consecutive workouts".
* The UI should allow clear selection of the exercise the condition applies to (if applicable), the specific metric (fact), operator (e.g., >=, =, <, completed), and value.
* The structure of defined rule conditions must conform to a **Zod schema** to ensure validity before being saved and processed by the `json-rules-engine`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can navigate to a "Create New Progression Rule" screen.
* AC2: User can enter and save a name for the new rule.
* AC3: User can add at least one condition from the supported list (Completion Status, Achieved Reps vs. Target, Specific Rep Count, Consecutive Successes/Failures).
* AC4: For each condition, user can specify the relevant parameters (e.g., exercise, metric/fact, operator, value).
* AC5: The system correctly stores the defined conditions (which pass Zod validation) as part of the rule being created (this story focuses on defining; saving the full rule is Story 3.2).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/rules/pages/CreateRulePage.tsx` (or `EditRulePage.tsx`)
    * `src/features/rules/components/RuleConditionBuilder.tsx`
    * `src/features/rules/components/ConditionForm.tsx`
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `ProgressionRule` interface, specifically the `conditions` part, and Zod schema are defined, aligning with `json-rules-engine` structure).
    * `src/config/frxConstants.ts` (for selectable facts, operators).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure & `docs/Progression Rules Engine (FRX).md` for condition structure examples)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Input`, `Select`, `Button`, `Card`)
  * Zod: (for rule condition Zod schema)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * `json-rules-engine` (concepts for condition structure)
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * N/A for this story (UI definition part).

* **Data Structures:**
  * Rule `conditions` object compatible with `json-rules-engine` (e.g., using `all`, `any`, `fact`, `operator`, `value`, `path`).
  * Zod schema for the `conditions` part of the `ProgressionRule` data model.
  * Supported facts (derived from `FRX Implementation Plan.md` section 2): `lastWorkoutExercisePerformance` (properties: `allTargetSetsCompleted`, `minRepsAchievedOnTargetSets`, `lastSet.achievedReps`), `exerciseHistoricalStats` (properties: `consecutiveProgressions`, `consecutiveFailuresToMeetTarget`).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * UI should be dynamic to allow adding multiple conditions.
  * Validation messages from Zod should be user-friendly.
  * Refer to `docs/Progression Rules Engine (FRX).md` for examples of condition JSON structure.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the rule creation page, focusing on naming the rule and a dynamic section for adding/configuring conditions.
* [ ] Define the data structure for storing rule conditions in a way that's compatible with `json-rules-engine` (e.g., using `all` for AND logic).
* [ ] Define a Zod schema for validating the structure of these rule conditions. This schema should align with `json-rules-engine` requirements and the fields defined in `docs/data-models.md` for `ProgressionRule.conditions`.
* [ ] Implement UI components (`ConditionForm.tsx`, `RuleConditionBuilder.tsx`) allowing users to select exercises (from Dexie), choose facts/metrics (e.g., "Achieved Reps on Last Set", "All Sets Completed"), operators (>=, =, <, etc.), and input values.
* [ ] Implement client-side validation of the configured conditions using the Zod schema, providing feedback in the UI.
* [ ] Manage the state of the rule being built (name and list of conditions) within the UI.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRX testplan.md` for detailed areas.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `RuleConditionBuilder.tsx` and `ConditionForm.tsx` for correct rendering, user interactions, and state updates with valid/invalid inputs.
  * Test Zod schema for rule conditions with various valid and invalid structures.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the flow of adding multiple conditions to a rule in the UI and verify the resulting data structure.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Navigate to create rule page, enter a name, add multiple conditions with different parameters, verify UI updates correctly.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRX testplan.md` for the overall approach and FRX specific scenarios)_
