# Story 2.7: Enhanced Custom Exercise Details for Advanced Logging

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user creating or editing a custom exercise, I want the option to note if it's typically performed with a specific advanced set structure (e.g., "Kroc Rows - typically AMRAP"), so that the logging interface might pre-select or suggest that structure when I add it to a workout.

**Context:** This story enhances the custom exercise definition feature (from Story 1.4) by allowing users to associate exercises with typical advanced set types. This provides richer data for the user and potential hints for the logging UI.

## Detailed Requirements

* When creating/editing a custom exercise (FR4.2), provide an optional field or tags where a user can associate it with a common advanced set type.
* This is primarily for user reference or for potential future intelligence in the app.
* The primary logging interface will still allow any set type to be chosen for any exercise.
* The data structure for this (likely within `ExerciseDefinition` in `docs/data-models.md`) must be validated using its corresponding **Zod schema** if specific structured data is stored, or it's just a free-text note. If it's a structured tag, Zod validation applies. `docs/data-models.md` proposes `typicalAdvancedSetType?: string;` on `ExerciseDefinition`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When defining a custom exercise, user can optionally add a note or tag indicating a typical advanced set structure associated with it (e.g., by selecting from a list: 'AMRAP Reps', 'AMRAP Time', 'Pyramid', 'Drop Set', or free text).
* AC2: This note/tag (e.g., `typicalAdvancedSetType` string) is saved with the custom exercise details and passes Zod validation if structured (Zod schema for `ExerciseDefinition` updated to include this optional field).
* AC3: (Optional V1.0 - if simple to implement) When adding this exercise to a workout, the UI might subtly hint or make it slightly easier to select the associated advanced set type.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/exercises/components/ExerciseForm.tsx` (from Story 1.4, to add field for `typicalAdvancedSetType`).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (update `ExerciseDefinition` interface and Zod schema).
    * `src/services/data/exerciseService.ts` (update CRUD to handle the new field).
  * Files to Potentially Modify (for AC3):
    * `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx` (or similar, to read and use this hint).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` & `docs/data-models.md` for `ExerciseDefinition` details)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Input` or `Select` for the new field), Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for updating `ExerciseDefinition` records.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ExerciseDefinition` interface updated to include `typicalAdvancedSetType?: string;`.
  * Zod schema for `ExerciseDefinition` updated to include this optional string field.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Ensure the Zod schema for `ExerciseDefinition` is updated and handles the optional nature of `typicalAdvancedSetType`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI modifications in the `ExerciseForm.tsx` to add an optional field (e.g., a text input or a select dropdown with predefined advanced set types) for `typicalAdvancedSetType`.
* [ ] Update the `ExerciseDefinition` TypeScript interface in `src/types/data.types.ts` (or equivalent) to include `typicalAdvancedSetType?: string;`.
* [ ] Update the Zod schema for `ExerciseDefinition` to include validation for the new optional `typicalAdvancedSetType` field (e.g., `z.string().optional()`).
* [ ] Modify `exerciseService.ts` (or equivalent) to include `typicalAdvancedSetType` in create/update operations for `ExerciseDefinition` entities, ensuring it's handled by Zod validation.
* [ ] (Optional, for AC3) If implementing the UI hint:
  * Modify the workout logging UI (`SetInputRow.tsx` or similar) to retrieve the `typicalAdvancedSetType` for the selected exercise.
  * Implement a subtle UI indication or pre-selection mechanism based on this information.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `ExerciseForm` component: Adding/editing the `typicalAdvancedSetType` field.
  * Test Zod schema update for `ExerciseDefinition`.
  * Test `exerciseService.ts` logic for handling the new field during CRUD operations.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test creating/editing an exercise with the `typicalAdvancedSetType` and verify it's correctly saved/retrieved from Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Create a custom exercise, add a `typicalAdvancedSetType` note. Edit the exercise and verify the note is present/can be changed.
  * (If AC3 implemented) Verify UI hint appears when adding this exercise to a workout.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
