# Story 6.4: Workout Log/History View - Detailed Workout Display

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, when I select a past workout from my history, I want to see a detailed breakdown of all exercises and sets performed, including accurate representation of any advanced set types, so I can thoroughly review my performance.

**Context:** This story provides the detailed view of a single workout session, building upon the list view from Story 6.3. It's crucial for users to accurately review their past performance, especially with the various advanced set types introduced in Epic 2.

## Detailed Requirements

* When a workout is selected from the history list (Story 6.3), display a detailed view of that session.
* For each exercise in the session, display all logged sets with weight, reps, and any notes.
* **Accurately display advanced set types** as logged in Epic 2:
  * AMRAP (reps/time) sets with their specific logged data.
  * Reps for Time sets with logged time and reps.
  * Pyramid sets showing all sub-sets and their individual performances, correctly grouped and sequenced.
  * Drop sets showing all sub-sets and their individual performances, correctly grouped and sequenced.
* Display workout summary metrics (total duration from `WorkoutLog.durationMs`, potentially calculated total volume, number of exercises/sets).
* Data displayed in this view/component will primarily be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)** (e.g., fetching a specific `WorkoutLog` and its associated `LoggedSet`s).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select a workout from the history list (Story 6.3) and view its detailed contents, with data fetched reactively using `useLiveQuery` (specific `WorkoutLog` and its `LoggedSet`s).
* AC2: All exercises performed in the workout are listed, and for each, their standard sets (weight/reps/notes) are displayed correctly.
* AC3: AMRAP (reps/time) sets are clearly identified and display all relevant logged data (e.g., weight, achieved reps, target duration for AMRAP-Time).
* AC4: Reps for Time sets are clearly identified and display logged time taken and reps achieved/target.
* AC5: Pyramid sets are displayed with all their sub-sets (linked by `groupKey`, ordered by `level`) and individual performances correctly grouped and sequenced.
* AC6: Drop sets are displayed with all their sub-sets (linked by `groupKey`, ordered by `level`) and individual performances correctly grouped and sequenced.
* AC7: Workout summary metrics (e.g., duration, total volume if calculated) are displayed for the selected workout.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/history/pages/DetailedWorkoutViewPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/history/components/ExerciseHistoryCard.tsx`
    * `src/features/history/components/SetHistoryDisplay.tsx` (a component that can render different set types correctly).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (`WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet` union types: `StandardSet`, `AmrapRepsSet`, `AmrapTimeSet`, `RepsForTimeSet`, `PyramidSet`, `DropSet`).
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts` (or direct Dexie queries).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. This story heavily relies on the `LoggedSet` structures from `docs/data-models.md` and Epic 2.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`, TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch a specific `WorkoutLog` by its ID, and all associated `LoggedSet`s (e.g., `db.loggedSets.where('workoutLogId').equals(selectedWorkoutLogId).sortBy('[orderInWorkout+orderInExercise]')`).
  * Logic to group `LoggedSet`s by `exerciseDefinitionId` and then by `groupKey` for Pyramid/Drop sets.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `WorkoutLog`.
  * All variants of `LoggedSet` (`StandardSet`, `AmrapRepsSet`, `AmrapTimeSet`, `RepsForTimeSet`, `PyramidSet`, `DropSet`).
  * Need to correctly interpret `setType`, `groupKey`, and `level` fields from `LoggedSet` to render complex sets.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The `SetHistoryDisplay.tsx` component will need a switch or conditional rendering logic based on `LoggedSet.setType` to display each type correctly.
  * For Pyramid/Drop sets, ensure sub-sets sharing a `groupKey` are rendered together and ordered by their `level` or `orderInExercise`.
  * Total volume calculation: Sum of (weight * reps) for all sets in the workout.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the detailed workout view, ensuring clear and distinct presentation for all standard and advanced set types (AMRAPs, Reps for Time, Pyramids, Drop Sets).
* [ ] Implement `DetailedWorkoutViewPage.tsx` that takes a `workoutLogId` as a parameter.
* [ ] Use `useLiveQuery` to fetch the specified `WorkoutLog` and all its associated `LoggedSet`s from Dexie.js.
* [ ] Implement logic to group `LoggedSet`s by `exerciseDefinitionId`.
* [ ] Implement `SetHistoryDisplay.tsx` component that dynamically renders set details based on `LoggedSet.setType`.
  * Display standard fields: weight, reps, notes.
  * For AMRAP (reps): Show achieved reps.
  * For AMRAP (time): Show target duration, achieved reps.
  * For Reps for Time: Show target reps, time taken.
  * For Pyramid/Drop sets: Fetch all sets with the same `groupKey`, sort by `level` or `orderInExercise`, and display them sequentially as a single logical block.
* [ ] Calculate and display workout summary metrics (duration, total volume).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `SetHistoryDisplay.tsx` with mocked `LoggedSet` data of each type (`StandardSet`, `AmrapRepsSet`, etc.) to verify correct rendering of details.
  * Test logic for grouping/sorting sets for display, especially for Pyramid/Drop sets.
  * Test volume calculation logic.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Seed Dexie.js with a `WorkoutLog` containing various advanced set types. Test `DetailedWorkoutViewPage.tsx` to ensure it correctly fetches (via `useLiveQuery`) and renders all data accurately.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Log workouts containing each advanced set type (from Epic 2). Navigate to history, select these workouts, and verify all details (including specific fields for AMRAPs, time for RepsForTime, sequence for Pyramids/Drops) are displayed correctly.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
