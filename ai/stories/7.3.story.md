# Story 7.3: StrongLifts Data Import - Feedback, Saving & Conflict Handling

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user importing StrongLifts data, I want to receive clear feedback on the import process, see a summary of what was imported, and have any potential data conflicts handled gracefully, so I can trust the migration.

**Context:** This story completes the StrongLifts import feature by handling the saving of parsed and validated data (from Story 7.2) into Dexie.js, providing user feedback, and managing potential data conflicts like duplicate workouts.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide clear feedback to the user during and after the import process (e.g., progress indicator for parsing/saving, success message, error messages).
* Display a summary upon completion, including the number of workouts and new exercises successfully imported.
* Report any significant errors or data that could not be mapped or validated (from Story 7.2).
* Implement a strategy for handling potential conflicts, such as duplicate workouts for a given date (e.g., offer to skip duplicates, overwrite, or merge if feasible; for V1.0, skipping duplicates might be the simplest safe approach).
* Imported workout data (validated `WorkoutLog`s, `LoggedSet`s, and new `ExerciseDefinition`s) must be saved into the user's StrongLog workout history (IndexedDB) and be fully accessible through the workout log/history views (Epic 6).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User sees a progress indicator or status messages during the data import (parsing and saving phases).
* AC2: Upon completion, a summary message clearly indicates the number of workouts and new exercises imported.
* AC3: Any errors encountered during parsing, mapping, Zod validation (from Story 7.2), or saving are clearly communicated to the user (e.g., "X workouts could not be imported due to unrecognized format").
* AC4: The system correctly handles potential duplicate workout entries based on the defined V1.0 strategy (e.g., duplicates for the same date/exercise combination are skipped and user is notified).
* AC5: Successfully imported and Zod-validated `WorkoutLog`s, `LoggedSet`s, and new `ExerciseDefinition`s are saved to their respective Dexie.js tables.
* AC6: Imported workouts are visible and correctly displayed in the StrongLog workout history view (Epic 6.3, 6.4).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/data-management/pages/ImportDataPage.tsx` (or `StrongLiftsImportPage.tsx` - to display feedback and summary).
    * `src/features/data-management/services/strongLiftsImporter.ts` (extend to include saving logic and conflict handling).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts` (for saving `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`).
    * `src/services/data/exerciseService.ts` (for saving new `ExerciseDefinition`).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Zod schemas are applied before this stage).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. This story consumes output from Story 7.2 and writes to Dexie.js.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Progress` bar, `Alert` for messages), TypeScript.
  * Dexie.js (for bulk saving, conflict checking).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API: `db.transaction()`, `table.bulkAdd()`, `table.add()`, queries to check for existing workouts/exercises.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Arrays of Zod-validated `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`, and new `ExerciseDefinition` objects (input from Story 7.2).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Saving imported data should be done within a Dexie transaction for atomicity if multiple tables are involved per workout.
  * Conflict resolution for duplicates: For V1.0, check if a workout log already exists for the same user on the exact same `startTime`. If so, skip importing that specific workout and its sets, and inform the user.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI elements for displaying import progress (e.g., percentage or steps like "Parsing...", "Saving workouts..."), success summary (count of imported items), and any error messages. Integrate these into `ImportDataPage.tsx`.
* [ ] Extend `strongLiftsImporter.ts` (or a new data saving service called by it) to:
  * Implement the V1.0 conflict resolution strategy: Before attempting to save an imported `WorkoutLog`, query Dexie.js to see if a log with the same `startTime` already exists. If so, skip it.
  * Save new `ExerciseDefinition`s (created in Story 7.2 if names didn't match) to Dexie.js using `exerciseService.ts`.
  * Save the arrays of successfully parsed, Zod-validated, and conflict-checked `WorkoutLog` and `LoggedSet` objects to Dexie.js using `workoutService.ts` (potentially using `bulkAdd` for efficiency, wrapped in a transaction).
* [ ] Track counts of successfully imported items and any skipped/errored items to display in the summary.
* [ ] Ensure that the UI is updated reactively to show the progress and final summary.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for feedback/summary display with various states (in progress, success, error).
  * Test conflict resolution logic in `strongLiftsImporter.ts` (mock Dexie calls to simulate existing data).
  * Test data saving logic (mock Dexie `bulkAdd`/`add` calls).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test the full import pipeline from parsed data (output of Story 7.2) through conflict checking and saving to Dexie.js. Verify correct items are saved and skipped.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Upload a StrongLifts CSV. Verify progress messages. Verify success summary with correct counts. Check workout history (Epic 6 UI) to ensure imported workouts appear correctly.
  * User flow: Upload a CSV containing some workouts that would be duplicates of already existing StrongLog workouts. Verify duplicate handling (e.g., skipping) and notification.
  * User flow: Upload a malformed or partially unmappable CSV. Verify error reporting.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach. Test with various CSVs: new user, user with some overlapping data.)_
