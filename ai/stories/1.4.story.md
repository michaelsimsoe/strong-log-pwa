# Story 1.4: Basic Exercise Definition & Management with Data Seeding

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to define custom exercises, view a list of available exercises including pre-populated ones, so that I can accurately track my workouts.

**Context:** This story enables users to personalize their exercise database, a core requirement for flexible workout logging. It also ensures a good out-of-the-box experience by providing a pre-populated list of common exercises.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide an interface for users to create new custom exercises.
* At a minimum, a custom exercise must have a unique `name`. Validation via Zod should be used.
* Optionally, users can specify primary `equipment` and default `units` (kg/lbs) for an exercise.
* Display a list of all available exercises (custom + pre-populated).
* Allow users to edit or delete their custom exercises.
* A **comprehensive pre-populated list of exercises** (beyond the few examples, as per `ts-epic1.md` implying a larger list) needs to be integrated and seeded into IndexedDB on first use or if the store is empty.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can successfully create a new custom exercise by providing its name, with data validated by Zod before saving.
* AC2: User can optionally specify equipment and default units when creating/editing an exercise.
* AC3: All created and pre-populated exercises are listed in a browseable/searchable view.
* AC4: User can select a custom exercise and edit its properties (with Zod validation).
* AC5: User can delete a custom exercise (with confirmation).
* AC6: A comprehensive list of pre-populated exercises is available and visible in the exercise list after initial app setup.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/exercises/components/ExerciseForm.tsx`
    * `src/features/exercises/components/ExerciseListItem.tsx`
    * `src/features/exercises/pages/ExerciseListPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/exercises/pages/CreateExercisePage.tsx`
    * `src/features/exercises/pages/EditExercisePage.tsx`
    * `src/services/data/exerciseService.ts` (or similar for `ExerciseDefinition` CRUD ops with Zod validation, using `db.ts` from Story 1.2)
    * `src/config/seedData/exercises.ts` (for the pre-populated list)
    * `src/services/data/db.ts` (modify to include seeding logic if not already there) or `scripts/seed-db.ts`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure and `docs/data-models.md` for `ExerciseDefinition` details)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Input`, `Button`, `Table` or list components, `Dialog` for confirmation)
  * Dexie.js: (from Story 1.2)
  * Zod: (for `ExerciseDefinition` schema from Story 1.2)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for CRUD operations on `exerciseDefinitions` table.
  * `shadcn/ui` components for forms and lists.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ExerciseDefinition` interface and Zod schema.
  * Array of `ExerciseDefinition` objects for pre-populated data.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Ensure Zod validation is applied before any write operation to Dexie.js for `ExerciseDefinition`.
  * Handle uniqueness constraint for `ExerciseDefinition.name` gracefully in the UI (Dexie.js will throw an error if `&name` index is violated).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for creating/editing custom exercises (using `shadcn/ui` components like `Input`, `Select`, `Button`).
* [ ] Design UI for listing/Browse exercises (e.g., using a `shadcn/ui` `Table` or custom list components, with search/filter capabilities).
* [ ] Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for `ExerciseDefinition` entities in `src/services/data/exerciseService.ts` (or similar), interacting with Dexie.js (`db.exerciseDefinitions`) and incorporating Zod validation for create/update operations.
* [ ] Connect the UI components to these CRUD service functions.
* [ ] **(Data Seeding):** Prepare a comprehensive list of pre-defined `ExerciseDefinition` objects (e.g., in `src/config/seedData/exercises.ts`). Include fields like `name`, `equipment`, `isCustom: false`.
* [ ] **(Data Seeding):** Implement a data seeding mechanism within `src/services/data/db.ts` (e.g., during Dexie class instantiation or via a dedicated function called on app startup) to populate the `exerciseDefinitions` table with the pre-defined list if the table is empty. This ensures data is available on first use.
* [ ] Implement UI for deleting custom exercises, including a confirmation dialog (e.g., `shadcn/ui AlertDialog`).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `ExerciseForm` component: Submitting form with valid/invalid data, interaction with mocked service calls.
  * Test `ExerciseListPage` component: Rendering list of exercises, search/filter functionality with mocked data.
  * Test `exerciseService.ts` (or equivalent) functions: Mock Dexie.js and Zod to test CRUD logic, validation handling, and error conditions.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the flow of creating a new exercise via the UI, verifying it's correctly saved to Dexie.js (using a real Dexie instance) and appears in the list.
  * Test editing and deleting custom exercises.
  * Test the data seeding process: Verify pre-populated exercises are in Dexie.js after initial setup on an empty DB.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Full user flow: Create a custom exercise, find it in the list, edit it, then delete it.
  * Verify pre-populated exercises are listed.
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  * Inspect IndexedDB to confirm custom and seeded exercises are stored correctly.
  * Test unique name constraint for exercises.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
