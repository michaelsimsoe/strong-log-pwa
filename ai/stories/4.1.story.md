# Story 4.1: Program Definition - Structure & Workout Sequence

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create a new training program by giving it a name and defining an ordered sequence or cycle of specific workouts, so that I can structure my long-term training.

**Context:** This story initiates the development of the Program Management feature (FRY Engine). It focuses on the user interface and backend logic for defining the basic structure of a training program, including its name and the sequence of workouts it contains. This lays the foundation for more advanced program features like frequency setting, rule linking, and active tracking.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a UI section for creating new programs.
* User must be able to assign a unique `name` to each program (e.g., "My 5/3/1 Wendler Cycle," "Strength Block Phase 1").
* User must be able to define a program as a sequence of distinct `workout sessions` (e.g., Workout A, Workout B, Workout C).
* Each workout session within the program should be built using existing workout templates (from Epic 1 / FR4) or allow for ad-hoc definition of exercises and their set/rep schemes (including advanced set types from Epic 2 / FR3.2) specifically for that program step.
* Users should be able to reorder, add, or remove workout sessions within the program definition.
* The `ProgramDefinition` data structure, including its `workoutSequence` and embedded `ProgramWorkoutDefinitionEntry` or `adHocExercises` structures (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`), must be validated using corresponding **Zod schemas** before being saved to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can navigate to a "Create New Program" screen.
* AC2: User can enter and save a name for the new program.
* AC3: User can add at least two distinct workout sessions (e.g., "Workout A," "Workout B") to the program sequence, defining the exercises and their set/rep structures for each (either by selecting a template or defining ad-hoc).
* AC4: User can reorder the workout sessions within the program sequence.
* AC5: The defined program structure (name, sequence of workouts with their content) is validated by Zod schemas and saved persistently as a `ProgramDefinition` in IndexedDB.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/programs/pages/CreateProgramPage.tsx` (or `EditProgramPage.tsx`)
    * `src/features/programs/components/ProgramWorkoutBuilder.tsx` (for defining a workout within the program sequence)
    * `src/features/programs/components/ProgramWorkoutDefinitionForm.tsx` (for ad-hoc exercise definition or template selection)
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `ProgramDefinition`, `ProgramWorkoutDefinitionEntry`, `WorkoutTemplateExerciseInstance` interfaces and Zod schemas are as per `docs/data-models.md`).
    * `src/services/data/programService.ts` (for saving `ProgramDefinition` to Dexie.js).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure & `docs/data-models.md` for `ProgramDefinition` structure details. `docs/Program Management & Adaptive Scheduling Engine (FRY).md` provides conceptual data structures.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Input`, `Button`, `Card`, `Dialog` for template/exercise selection, drag-and-drop components for reordering if feasible)
  * Zod: (for `ProgramDefinition` Zod schema)
  * Dexie.js: (from Story 1.2)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving `ProgramDefinition` objects.
  * UI will need to fetch existing `WorkoutTemplate` list (from Story 1.4) for selection.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ProgramDefinition` as per `docs/data-models.md`:

        ```typescript
        export interface ProgramDefinition {
          id?: string; // UUID
          name: string;
          description?: string;
          targetFrequency: { type: 'perWeek' | 'everyXDays'; value: number; }; // Covered in 4.2
          workoutSequence: ProgramWorkoutDefinitionEntry[];
          linkedProgressionRuleIds?: { ruleId: string; scope: 'program' | 'workoutInProgram' | 'exerciseInProgram'; scopeIdentifier?: string; }[]; // Covered in 4.2
        }

        export interface ProgramWorkoutDefinitionEntry {
          orderInProgram: number;
          dayTag?: string;
          workoutTemplateId?: string; // FK to WorkoutTemplate
          adHocExercises?: WorkoutTemplateExerciseInstance[]; // If not using template
          notes?: string;
        }
        // WorkoutTemplateExerciseInstance is also defined in data-models.md
        ```

  * Zod schema for `ProgramDefinition` and its nested structures.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * UI should allow for dynamic addition/removal/reordering of workout sessions in the sequence.
  * Ensure Zod validation covers the entire `ProgramDefinition` object, including the `workoutSequence` array and its contents.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the program creation page, including program name input and a dynamic list for defining the workout sequence.
* [ ] Implement UI for adding a workout session to the sequence. This should allow either selecting an existing `WorkoutTemplate` or defining exercises ad-hoc (reusing/adapting UI from template creation or exercise logging for defining exercises, sets, reps, including advanced set types).
* [ ] Implement functionality to reorder workout sessions in the defined sequence (e.g., drag and drop, or move up/down buttons).
* [ ] Define the Zod schema for the `ProgramDefinition` entity, ensuring it validates the `name`, `workoutSequence` array, and the structure of `ProgramWorkoutDefinitionEntry` (including `workoutTemplateId` or `adHocExercises`).
* [ ] Implement `programService.ts` to handle saving the Zod-validated `ProgramDefinition` object to the `programDefinitions` table in Dexie.js.
* [ ] Implement client-side validation using Zod within the program definition UI before attempting to save.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRY testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for program creation (name input, workout sequence builder).
  * Test Zod schema for `ProgramDefinition` with various valid/invalid structures, especially for `workoutSequence` and ad-hoc exercise definitions.
  * Test `programService.ts` for saving programs (mock Dexie.js).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test creating a program with a sequence of workouts (mixing template-based and ad-hoc), reordering them, and saving. Verify correct data structure is saved to Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Navigate to create program, name it, add several workout sessions (some using templates, some ad-hoc), reorder them, save. Verify program appears in library (Story 4.3).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRY testplan.md` for detailed areas)_
