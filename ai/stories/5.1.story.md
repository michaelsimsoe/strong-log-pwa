# Story 5.1: Goal Definition - Creating Various Goal Types

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to define different types of training goals, such as specific lift targets (e.g., squat X weight for Y reps), program completion, or bodyweight targets, with optional target dates, so I can clearly articulate my objectives.

**Context:** This story introduces the "Goals" module (FRZ) by enabling users to define various types of training goals. It includes the UI for goal creation, the data structures for storing these goals, validation, and the necessary prerequisite of basic bodyweight logging.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a UI section for creating new goals.
* User must be able to assign a `name` or description to each goal.
* Supported goal types must include:
  * **Specific Lift Target:** Target `weight` for a specific `number of reps` (e.g., 1RM, 3RM, 5RM) for a chosen `exercise`.
  * **Program Completion:** Target completing a specific `Program` (from FRY).
  * **Bodyweight Target:** Target `bodyweight`.
* Allow users to set an optional `target date` for achieving the goal.
* Goals should be classifiable as `short-term` or `long-term` (user-defined tag).
* The `UserGoal` data structure, encompassing all supported goal types and their respective fields (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`), must be validated using a comprehensive **Zod schema** before being saved to Dexie.js.
* A simple mechanism for users to log their bodyweight must be available to support the 'Bodyweight Target' goal type.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can navigate to a "Create New Goal" screen.
* AC2: User can define a "Specific Lift Target" goal by selecting an exercise, specifying target weight and reps.
* AC3: User can define a "Program Completion" goal by selecting one of their defined programs.
* AC4: User can define a "Bodyweight Target" goal (prerequisite: bodyweight logging UI from this story is functional).
* AC5: User can optionally set a target completion date for any goal.
* AC6: User can categorize a goal as short-term or long-term (e.g., using a simple tag or select input).
* AC7: Defined goals are validated by a Zod schema and saved persistently as a `UserGoal` in IndexedDB.
* AC8: A basic UI for logging bodyweight (date and weight) is functional and saves entries to the `UserBodyweightLog` table in Dexie.js.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/goals/pages/CreateGoalPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/goals/components/GoalForm.tsx` (dynamic form for different goal types)
    * `src/features/goals/components/BodyweightLogForm.tsx` (for AC8)
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `UserGoal`, `UserBodyweightLog` interfaces and Zod schemas as per `docs/data-models.md`).
    * `src/services/data/goalService.ts` (for saving `UserGoal` and `UserBodyweightLog` to Dexie.js).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure. `docs/data-models.md` details `UserGoal` and `UserBodyweightLog`. `docs/FRZ Implementation Plan.md` highlights the bodyweight logging prerequisite.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Input`, `Select`, `Button`, `DatePicker`, `RadioGroup`)
  * Zod: (for `UserGoal`, `UserBodyweightLog` Zod schemas)
  * Dexie.js: (from Story 1.2)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving `UserGoal` and `UserBodyweightLog` objects.
  * UI will need to fetch existing `ExerciseDefinition` list (Story 1.4) and `ProgramDefinition` list (Story 4.1) for selection.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserGoal` as per `docs/data-models.md`, including fields like `name`, `type: GoalType`, `status: GoalStatus`, `targetDate`, `creationDate`, `targetExerciseDefinitionId`, `targetWeightKg`, `targetReps`, `targetProgramDefinitionId`, `targetBodyweightKg`, `currentValue`.
  * `UserBodyweightLog` as per `docs/data-models.md`: `{ id?: string; date: number; weightKg: number; }`.
  * Zod schemas for `UserGoal` (using discriminated unions for `type`-specific fields) and `UserBodyweightLog`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The `GoalForm.tsx` should dynamically adapt to the selected `GoalType`.
  * Zod validation must be thorough for all goal types and their specific fields.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the "Create New Goal" page, allowing selection of goal type and dynamic input fields based on the chosen type.
* [ ] Design and implement a simple UI for logging bodyweight entries (date input, weight input) and a button to save. This could be a separate small section or modal.
* [ ] Ensure `UserGoal` and `UserBodyweightLog` interfaces are correctly defined in `src/types/data.types.ts` as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Define comprehensive Zod schemas for `UserGoal` (using discriminated unions for different `GoalType` fields like `targetExerciseDefinitionId`, `targetWeightKg` etc.) and `UserBodyweightLog`.
* [ ] Implement `goalService.ts` (or extend existing data services) to handle saving Zod-validated `UserGoal` objects and `UserBodyweightLog` entries to their respective Dexie.js tables.
* [ ] Implement client-side validation using these Zod schemas within the goal definition and bodyweight logging UIs before saving.
* [ ] Populate dropdowns for selecting exercises (from `exerciseDefinitions` table) and programs (from `programDefinitions` table) when defining relevant goal types.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRZ testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `GoalForm.tsx` for dynamic rendering based on goal type, input handling, and validation feedback.
  * Test `BodyweightLogForm.tsx` for input handling and saving.
  * Test Zod schemas for `UserGoal` (all types) and `UserBodyweightLog` with valid/invalid data.
  * Test `goalService.ts` for saving goals and bodyweight entries (mock Dexie.js).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test creating each type of goal via the UI and verify correct data (validated by Zod) is saved to Dexie.js.
  * Test logging bodyweight and verify it's saved to Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Navigate to create goal -> Define a 'Specific Lift Target' -> Save. Define a 'Program Completion' goal -> Save. Define a 'Bodyweight Target' -> Log a bodyweight entry -> Save goal. Verify goals appear in library (Story 5.2).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRZ testplan.md` for detailed areas)_
