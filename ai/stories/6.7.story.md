# Story 6.7: Analytics - Goal Analytics Display

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user with active goals, I want to see analytical views of my progress towards these goals, including trajectories where applicable, so I can understand how I'm tracking against my targets.

**Context:** This story provides dedicated analytical views for user-defined goals (from Epic 5), offering more detailed insights than the dashboard snapshot. It includes charts and potentially simple trajectory estimations.

## Detailed Requirements

* For goals tied to specific lift targets, display charts showing current e1RM/Rep Max against the goal target over time. Charts will use **Recharts**.
* For V1.0, 'projected trajectory' for goals will be based on simple trend analysis of recent performance improvements (e.g., rate of change of e1RM for a lift target), or if the FRX/FRY engines can output a quantifiable expected rate of progression for specific exercises under active rules/programs. Complex predictive modeling is out of scope for V1.0 client-side processing.
* List active goals with their current status and estimated time to completion (if calculable based on simple trajectory).
* Data displayed will be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)**.
* Complex trend analysis or trajectory calculations, if implemented beyond simple recent rate of change, should be considered for Web Worker offloading.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: For a selected lift-specific goal, a Recharts chart displays current performance (e.g., calculated e1RM trend from `LoggedSet`s) vs. the goal target over time.
* AC2: A list of active goals shows their current progress values and, where possible, a V1.0-appropriate estimated completion trajectory/date based on simple trend analysis.
* AC3: Data is accurate based on `UserGoal` definitions (Epic 5) and current performance data (from `LoggedSet`s and `UserGoal.currentValue`), fetched reactively.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/analytics/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx` (add goal analytics section).
    * `src/features/analytics/components/GoalSelector.tsx`.
    * `src/features/analytics/charts/GoalProgressChart.tsx` (for lift targets).
    * `src/features/analytics/components/GoalTrajectorySummary.tsx`.
    * `src/services/analytics/goalAnalyticsService.ts` (for data aggregation & trajectory - may call worker).
    * Potentially `src/services/analytics/analytics.worker.ts` (if offloading).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. Relies on data from Epic 5 and `LoggedSet`s.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Recharts, Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`, TypeScript.
  * Potentially Shared Web Workers & Comlink.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch `UserGoal`s and relevant `LoggedSet` data.
  * Recharts API.
  * Comlink (if worker used).

* **Data Structures:**
  * Input: `UserGoal`, historical `LoggedSet` data for relevant exercises.
  * Output: Data for lift progress chart (e.g., `[{ date: timestamp, currentE1RM: value, targetE1RM: value }, ...]`). Trajectory data (e.g., `{ estimatedCompletionDate: timestamp }`).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Simple trajectory logic for V1.0: e.g., linear extrapolation based on rate of change of `UserGoal.currentValue` over the last N data points or weeks. Clearly state assumptions.
  * Avoid over-promising with trajectory estimations.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for goal progression charts (lift targets) and the summary view with trajectory estimations.
* [ ] Implement `useLiveQuery` hooks in `goalAnalyticsService.ts` or components to fetch selected `UserGoal`s and historical `LoggedSet` data for the associated exercise.
* [ ] Implement data aggregation logic in `goalAnalyticsService.ts` to:
  * Prepare time-series data of e1RM/Rep Max for selected lift goals.
  * Implement simple trend analysis/trajectory estimation for goal completion date (V1.0 scope).
* [ ] **Profiling & Worker Decision:** Profile calculations. If complex/slow, design and implement offloading to `analytics.worker.ts`.
* [ ] Implement `GoalProgressChart.tsx` using Recharts for lift targets.
* [ ] Implement `GoalTrajectorySummary.tsx` to display the list of active goals with progress and estimated completion info.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRZ testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test data aggregation and trajectory estimation logic in `goalAnalyticsService.ts` with various performance data.
  * Test Recharts components with mocked data.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test fetching data via `useLiveQuery`, processing by `goalAnalyticsService.ts` (or worker), and passing to Recharts components. Seed Dexie.js with goals and workout history.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Define goals (Epic 5). Log workouts that show progress towards these goals.
  * Navigate to goal analytics. Verify charts and trajectory estimations display plausible data based on logged performance.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRZ testplan.md` for details)_
