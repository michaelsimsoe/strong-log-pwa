# Story 6.6: Analytics - Program Analytics Display

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user following a program, I want to see analytics related to my program adherence and overall progress through it, so I can assess how well I'm sticking to my plan.

**Context:** This story provides analytics specific to user engagement with training programs defined in Epic 4. It helps users understand their consistency and progress within their structured plans.

## Detailed Requirements

* Display an **Adherence Visualization** for active/completed programs (e.g., a chart or calendar view showing planned vs. actually completed workouts). Charts will use **Recharts**.
* Display a **Program Progress Overview** (e.g., percentage of program cycle completed, number of workouts remaining in current cycle).
* Data displayed will be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)**, primarily from `ActiveProgramInstance` and related `WorkoutLog`s.
* Complex calculations for adherence over long periods, if any, should consider Web Worker offloading (similar to Story 6.5).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select an active or past program and view a visual representation (using Recharts) of their adherence (e.g., planned vs. completed workouts over the program's duration or a selected period).
* AC2: User can see their percentage completion or current stage (e.g., "Workout 5 of 12") within a selected active program.
* AC3: Data presented is accurate based on `ProgramDefinition` (from Epic 4), `ActiveProgramInstance` state (updated by FRY), and logged `WorkoutLog`s, all fetched reactively.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/analytics/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx` (add program analytics section).
    * `src/features/analytics/components/ProgramSelector.tsx`.
    * `src/features/analytics/charts/ProgramAdherenceChart.tsx`.
    * `src/features/analytics/components/ProgramProgressOverview.tsx`.
    * `src/services/analytics/programAnalyticsService.ts` (for data aggregation - may call worker).
    * Potentially `src/services/analytics/analytics.worker.ts` (if offloading).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. Relies on data from Epic 4.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Recharts, Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`, TypeScript.
  * Potentially Shared Web Workers & Comlink.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch `ProgramDefinition`s, `ActiveProgramInstance`s, and relevant `WorkoutLog`s.
  * Recharts API.
  * Comlink (if worker used).

* **Data Structures:**
  * Input: `ActiveProgramInstance`, its linked `ProgramDefinition`, and associated `WorkoutLog`s.
  * Output: Data for adherence chart (e.g., `[{ date: timestamp, planned: 1, completed: 1 }, { date: timestamp, planned: 1, completed: 0 }]`). Data for progress overview (e.g., `{ percentComplete: 60, workoutsRemaining: 5 }`).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Adherence calculation: Compare `ActiveProgramInstance.completedWorkoutHistory` against the `ProgramDefinition.workoutSequence` and projected dates (from FRY logic/Story 4.5).
  * Clearly define how "planned" workouts are determined for past dates if the schedule was adaptive. Simplest might be to show completion against the defined program sequence.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for program adherence visualization (e.g., a Recharts bar chart showing completed vs. missed/skipped over time, or a calendar-like view) and progress overview.
* [ ] Implement `useLiveQuery` hooks in `programAnalyticsService.ts` or components to fetch `ActiveProgramInstance`s, their `ProgramDefinition`s, and related `WorkoutLog`s.
* [ ] Implement data aggregation logic in `programAnalyticsService.ts` to:
  * Calculate adherence metrics (e.g., map logged program workouts against the program's sequence and projected dates).
  * Calculate overall program progress percentage for active programs.
* [ ] **Profiling & Worker Decision:** Profile these calculations. If complex or slow with many program workouts, design and implement offloading to `analytics.worker.ts`.
* [ ] Implement `ProgramAdherenceChart.tsx` and `ProgramProgressOverview.tsx` using Recharts and other UI components.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test data aggregation functions in `programAnalyticsService.ts` for adherence and progress with various mocked program/log data.
  * Test Recharts components with mocked data.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test fetching data via `useLiveQuery`, processing by `programAnalyticsService.ts` (or worker), and passing to Recharts components. Seed Dexie.js with program and workout history.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Define and activate a program (Epic 4). Log several workouts, some on "projected" days, some off.
  * Navigate to program analytics. Verify adherence chart and progress overview accurately reflect the logged activity and program structure.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
