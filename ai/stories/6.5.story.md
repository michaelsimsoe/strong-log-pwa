# Story 6.5: Analytics - Exercise Performance Trend Charts

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view charts showing my performance trends for specific exercises over time (like e1RM, Volume, Rep Maxes), so I can visually track my strength and work capacity progress.

**Context:** This story begins the implementation of the dedicated analytics section, focusing on visualizing performance trends for individual exercises using charts. It introduces the Recharts library and addresses potential performance considerations for data aggregation.

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement a dedicated analytics section with various charts. Charts will be implemented using the **Recharts** library.
* Provide charts for:
  * Estimated 1 Rep Max (e1RM) over time for user-selected exercises. e1RM trends will be calculated using the **Epley formula** ($Weight \times (1 + Reps / 30)$) based on logged sets.
  * Total Volume (e.g., sum of (weight x reps) for all sets of an exercise in a workout) over time for user-selected exercises or muscle groups. (Muscle groups might be more complex for V1.0 if not easily queryable). Focus on per-exercise volume first.
  * Specific Rep Max (e.g., best logged 3RM, 5RM, 10RM weight) progression over time for user-selected exercises.
* Charts must be filterable by date range.
* Data displayed will be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)** for the base `LoggedSet` data.
* If data aggregation or transformation logic for generating these charts (e.g., calculating e1RM for every relevant set over a long history) is too computationally intensive for the main thread, these calculations should be offloaded to a **Web Worker**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select an exercise and view a Recharts chart of its e1RM trend (calculated using Epley formula from `LoggedSet` data) over time.
* AC2: User can select an exercise and view a Recharts chart of its total volume (per workout session) trend over time.
* AC3: User can select an exercise and view a Recharts chart of its X-Rep Max (e.g., best weight lifted for 5 reps) trend over time.
* AC4: All charts can be filtered by standard date ranges (e.g., last month, 3 months, year, all time).
* AC5: Charts are rendered clearly, are readable on mobile devices, and performant. If Web Workers are used for calculation, they function correctly and integrate smoothly.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/analytics/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx` (main container for analytics)
    * `src/features/analytics/components/ExerciseSelector.tsx`
    * `src/features/analytics/components/DateRangeFilter.tsx`
    * `src/features/analytics/charts/E1RMChart.tsx`
    * `src/features/analytics/charts/VolumeChart.tsx`
    * `src/features/analytics/charts/XRepMaxChart.tsx`
    * `src/services/analytics/exerciseAnalyticsService.ts` (for data aggregation logic - may call a worker).
    * Potentially `src/services/analytics/analytics.worker.ts` (if offloading is implemented).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/tech-stack.md` specifies Recharts. `docs/Goal Setting & Tracking Engine (FRZ).md` gives Epley formula.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, TypeScript.
  * Recharts: `~2.12.x`
  * Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`.
  * Potentially Shared Web Workers & Comlink (if calculations are offloaded).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch raw `LoggedSet` data for selected exercises and date ranges.
  * Recharts API for chart configuration and rendering.
  * If using a worker: Comlink to communicate with the analytics worker.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Input: `LoggedSet[]` for a specific exercise.
  * Output: Data arrays formatted for Recharts (e.g., `[{ date: timestamp, e1rm: value }, ...]`).
  * Intermediate structures for aggregated data.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Data aggregation logic (e1RM for many sets, volume calculation per session, finding best X-rep maxes) needs to be accurate and efficient.
  * Clearly define "relevant sets" for e1RM calculation (as in Story 5.3).
  * Profile performance of data aggregation on main thread first. If it blocks UI with substantial data, implement worker offloading.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Integrate the **Recharts** library into the project.
* [ ] Design the UI for the analytics section, including exercise selection, date range filters, and chart display areas.
* [ ] Implement `useLiveQuery` hooks in `exerciseAnalyticsService.ts` or chart components to fetch `LoggedSet` data for the selected exercise and date range.
* [ ] Implement data aggregation functions in `exerciseAnalyticsService.ts`:
  * To calculate e1RM (using Epley formula from `Goal Setting & Tracking Engine (FRZ).md`) for each relevant `LoggedSet` and prepare time-series data.
  * To calculate total volume per workout session for the selected exercise.
  * To find the best logged weight for specific rep counts (e.g., 3RM, 5RM, 10RM) over time.
* [ ] **Profiling & Worker Decision:** Profile these aggregation functions with significant data. If main thread performance is poor, proceed with tasks below; otherwise, worker can be deferred.
  * [ ] (If worker needed) Design the interface for `analytics.worker.ts` and set up Comlink communication.
  * [ ] (If worker needed) Move intensive aggregation logic into `analytics.worker.ts`.
* [ ] Implement `E1RMChart.tsx`, `VolumeChart.tsx`, `XRepMaxChart.tsx` components using Recharts, consuming data from `exerciseAnalyticsService.ts` (or worker).
* [ ] Ensure charts are responsive and provide a good user experience on mobile.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test data aggregation functions in `exerciseAnalyticsService.ts` (e1RM, volume, XRM) with various `LoggedSet` inputs.
  * Test Recharts chart components with mocked data to ensure correct rendering and configuration.
  * If worker is used, test worker communication and calculation logic with mocked Dexie.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test fetching data via `useLiveQuery`, processing it with `exerciseAnalyticsService.ts` (or worker), and passing it to Recharts components for rendering. Seed Dexie.js for this.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Log a series of workouts for specific exercises over time.
  * Navigate to analytics, select an exercise and date range.
  * Verify e1RM, volume, and XRM charts display data that accurately reflects the logged workouts.
  * Test chart responsiveness on different screen sizes.
* **Performance Testing (Manual/DevTools):**
  * Crucial for this story. Test chart loading and data processing times with a large amount of historical data to validate main thread performance or the effectiveness of worker offloading.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
