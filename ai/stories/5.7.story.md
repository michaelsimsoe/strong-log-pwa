# Story 5.7: Goal-Aware Progression Suggestions (Basic Integration with FRX)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user with active goals, I want the Progression Engine (FRX) to be subtly aware of my goals and potentially offer slightly adjusted suggestions if I'm close to a goal and performing well, so the system feels more integrated.

**Context:** This story defines a basic integration point where the FRZ engine's insights about goal proximity can subtly influence the FRX engine's suggestions. This is an advanced feature aiming for a more holistic user experience. `docs/fit_together.md` and `docs/FRZ Implementation Plan.md` touch on this.

## Detailed Requirements

* This is an advanced integration and should be kept simple for V1.0.
* The FRZ engine (or application logic/service that uses FRZ calculations) needs to provide relevant 'goal proximity' information (e.g., for a 'Specific Lift Target') in a way that the FRX engine can consume it as a 'fact' during its evaluation. This could involve FRZ writing a distilled summary/flag to `UserGoal.currentValue` or `UserGoal.notes` which FRX fact finders can read, or a dedicated fact like `fact_activeGoalProximity` as planned in `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`.
* If FRX is calculating a suggestion for an exercise, and there's a very specific, nearly-achieved "Specific Lift Target" goal for that exercise (fact provided based on FRZ data):
  * FRX _could_ slightly prioritize actions that help bridge that small gap if other conditions also support it.
* This should not override core progression logic but act as a minor "nudge" or tie-breaker.
* The user should still be able to see the base rule that triggered the FRX suggestion.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The FRX engine's fact-finding mechanism (Story 3.4) is extended to include a fact like `fact_activeGoalProximity` which can retrieve information about active 'Specific Lift Target' goals and their proximity to completion (e.g., based on `UserGoal.currentValue` vs. target).
* AC2: (If a clear, simple scenario is implemented for V1.0) An FRX rule condition can utilize this `fact_activeGoalProximity`. For example, a condition like "IF `fact_activeGoalProximity.isCloseToTarget` IS true AND `fact_lastWorkoutExercisePerformance.reps_good` IS true THEN Action X".
* AC3: Any goal-influenced suggestion from FRX is still presented transparently to the user, and the primary rule triggering it remains clear. User can still override. This feature must not lead to unsafe or overly aggressive progression suggestions that contradict the main rule logic.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/services/engines/frx/frxFactFinders.ts` (Add `fact_activeGoalProximity` fact finder).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Define structure for `ActiveGoalProximityFact`).
    * `src/features/rules/components/ConditionForm.tsx` (Potentially update UI to allow selecting this new fact if it's user-configurable, though for V1.0 this might be an internal FRX logic enhancement rather than new user-facing condition type).
  * _(Hint: `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md` section 2 outlines `fact_activeGoalProximity`. `docs/fit_together.md` discusses FRZ influencing FRX.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Dexie.js (FRX worker querying `userGoals` table).
  * `json-rules-engine` (within FRX worker).
  * TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * FRX worker's fact finder will use Dexie.js to query `userGoals` table, filtering by `exerciseDefinitionId`, `status: 'active'`, and `type: 'liftTarget'`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserGoal` (read by FRX fact finder, especially `targetWeightKg`, `targetReps`, `currentValue`).
  * `ActiveGoalProximityFact` (as defined in `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`):

        ```typescript
        interface ActiveGoalProximityFact {
          goalId?: string;
          isCloseToTarget: boolean; // e.g., within X% or Y reps/kg of a 'liftTarget' UserGoal
        }
        ```

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The "subtle influence" logic needs to be carefully designed to avoid unintended consequences in progression. For V1.0, this might be limited to a specific internal FRX rule or a small adjustment factor if conditions are met.
  * Ensure this does not create tight coupling that makes FRX heavily dependent on FRZ always providing perfect data.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Define the specific, limited scenarios for V1.0 where active goal proximity might influence FRX suggestions (e.g., if within 5% of target weight for a 1RM goal and last workout showed good performance, FRX might slightly favor an "increase weight" action if multiple actions are possible from a rule).
* [ ] Implement the `fact_activeGoalProximity` fact finder in `src/services/engines/frx/frxFactFinders.ts`. This fact finder will:
  * Accept `exerciseDefinitionId` as a parameter.
  * Query the `userGoals` table for active 'Specific Lift Target' goals related to that exercise.
  * Compare `UserGoal.currentValue` (calculated by FRZ in Story 5.3) with the goal's target weight/reps to determine if it's "close" (define "close" - e.g., within a certain percentage or absolute amount).
  * Return an `ActiveGoalProximityFact` object.
* [ ] (Optional, if making it a user-configurable condition) Update the rule definition UI (Story 3.1) to allow users to add conditions based on `fact_activeGoalProximity`. (More likely for V1.0, this is an internal enhancement to existing FRX logic rather than new user-facing condition).
* [ ] If not a user-configurable condition, existing FRX rules might be subtly modified or new internal system rules added that use this fact as an _additional_ AND condition to slightly prefer certain actions (e.g., "increase weight" if goal is close AND other performance metrics are good).
* [ ] Ensure that any progression made due to goal influence is still logged transparently in `AppliedProgressionLog` and ties back to a primary rule.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRZ testplan.md` and `docs/FRX testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test the `fact_activeGoalProximity` fact finder in `frxFactFinders.ts` with various `UserGoal` states (goal met, nearly met, far from met, no goal).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest, worker context):**
  * Test FRX rule evaluation (as in Story 3.4 tests) with rules that now incorporate conditions based on `fact_activeGoalProximity`. Seed Dexie.js with `UserGoal` data that should trigger these conditions and verify FRX output.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Difficult to isolate this specific "subtle influence" in E2E unless the effect is very pronounced and predictable. Focus on:
    * Create a specific lift goal that is very close to achievement.
    * Create an FRX rule that _could_ be influenced by this goal proximity.
    * Log a workout that meets the primary conditions of the FRX rule and also indicates strong performance.
    * Observe if the FRX suggestion for the next workout (Story 3.5/3.6) reflects the "nudge" (e.g., a slightly larger weight increase than if the goal wasn't close). This requires carefully crafted rules and test data.
  * Verify transparency: ensure the primary rule is still cited as the reason for progression, even if goal proximity was a factor.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`, `docs/FRX testplan.md`, and `docs/FRZ testplan.md` for details)_
