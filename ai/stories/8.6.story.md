# Story 8.6: Release Preparation & PWA Deployment (with CI/CD and Error Reporting)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the development team, we want to perform all final checks, optimize the PWA for production, establish CI/CD for deployment, and deploy StrongLog V1.0 to the hosting environment, so it's publicly accessible and maintainable.

**Context:** This is the final story leading up to the V1.0 release. It covers build optimization, CI/CD pipeline setup, optional error reporting integration, deployment to production, and post-deployment checks.

## Detailed Requirements

* Final review and optimization of PWA manifest (`manifest.json`) and service worker configuration (`vite-plugin-pwa` settings in `vite.config.ts`) for production (e.g., caching strategies, icons, theme colors).
* Minify and bundle all code assets (JS, CSS) for optimal performance using Vite's production build.
* Perform final Lighthouse PWA checks or similar audits to ensure good scores for performance, accessibility, best practices, and PWA installability.
* Set up any necessary analytics for app usage (e.g., basic PWA analytics, ensuring user privacy - specific tool TBD, can be simple or placeholder for V1.0).
* Prepare the production hosting environment (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3/CloudFront - choice as per `docs/architecture.md`).
* **(CI/CD - TS-20, TS-21):** A CI/CD pipeline must be established (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated building, running all tests (unit, integration, E2E from Playwright), and deployment of the PWA to staging and production environments.
* **(Error Reporting - Optional for V1.0 - TS-22):** If an external error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) is to be included for V1.0, it must be configured and integrated into the production build process. The `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable (from `docs/environment-vars.md`) would be used.
* Deploy the finalized V1.0 application build to the production server.
* Conduct post-deployment smoke testing to ensure the live application is working correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: PWA manifest (`public/manifest.json`) and service worker configurations (in `vite.config.ts` for `vite-plugin-pwa`) are reviewed and optimized for production.
* AC2: Vite production build successfully minifies and bundles all static assets.
* AC3: The application achieves good scores in Lighthouse PWA audits (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, PWA).
* AC4: Basic, privacy-respecting usage analytics are functional if implemented for V1.0.
* AC5: **(TS-20, TS-21)** A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is functional, automatically building the PWA, running all tests, and deploying successful builds from a designated branch to staging and (with appropriate triggers) to production environments.
* AC6: **(TS-22 - If implemented)** If Sentry (or chosen tool) is integrated, it's configured with `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and successfully reporting errors from production builds.
* AC7: The V1.0 application is successfully deployed to the production hosting environment and is publicly accessible via its domain.
* AC8: Post-deployment smoke tests (covering core functionalities like app load, anonymous logging, settings access) pass in the production environment.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * `vite.config.ts` (production build settings, `vite-plugin-pwa` final config).
  * `public/manifest.json` (final review).
  * `.github/workflows/deploy-pwa.yml` (or similar for CI/CD pipeline configuration).
  * `src/main.tsx` or `src/App.tsx` (for Sentry SDK initialization if TS-22 is done).
  * Deployment scripts (if any, specific to hosting provider).
  * _(Hint: `docs/architecture.md` discusses hosting options. `docs/environment-vars.md` for `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Vite (for production build: `pnpm run build`).
  * `vite-plugin-pwa` (for service worker and manifest).
  * CI/CD Platform (e.g., GitHub Actions).
  * Hosting Platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3/CloudFront).
  * Sentry SDK (or chosen error tracker, if TS-22 is implemented).
  * Lighthouse (for PWA audits).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * CI/CD platform APIs/actions for build, test, deploy steps.
  * Sentry SDK initialization (`Sentry.init(...)`) if used.

* **Data Structures:**
  * N/A. Focus is on build artifacts and deployment configurations.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * `NODE_ENV=production` (set by Vite build script).
  * `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (ensure production URL is set for production builds).
  * `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (if Sentry is used).

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * CI/CD pipeline configuration should be clean and maintainable.
  * Ensure environment variables are correctly configured for different environments (staging, production) in the CI/CD setup.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Final review and optimization of `public/manifest.json` (icons, names, colors) and `vite-plugin-pwa` configurations in `vite.config.ts` (caching strategies like `generateSW` with Workbox options) for production.
* [ ] Ensure Vite production build (`pnpm run build`) is configured for optimal minification, tree-shaking, and code splitting.
* [ ] Perform final Lighthouse PWA audits and address any critical issues found.
* [ ] (Optional V1.0) Set up basic, privacy-conscious PWA usage analytics (e.g., if hosting on Netlify/Vercel, they offer simple analytics, or a very minimal self-hosted solution if any).
* [ ] Prepare and configure the chosen production hosting environment (e.g., Netlify site setup, DNS if applicable).
* [ ] **(TS-20 CI/CD - Build & Test):** Implement a CI/CD workflow (e.g., in `.github/workflows/deploy-pwa.yml`) that triggers on pushes/PRs to `main`/`develop` branches to:
  * Check out code.
  * Set up Node.js and PNPM.
  * Install dependencies.
  * Run linters and formatters.
  * Run all Vitest unit/integration tests.
  * Build the PWA (`pnpm run build`).
  * Run all Playwright E2E tests against the build (e.g., using `vite preview`).
* [ ] **(TS-21 CI/CD - Staging Deploy):** Extend the CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy successful builds from a specific branch (e.g., `develop` or `release/candidate`) to a staging environment.
* [ ] **(CI/CD - Production Deploy):** Configure the CI/CD pipeline for deploying to the production environment. This might be a manual trigger on a staging-verified build/tag, or automated from a `main`/`release` branch.
* [ ] **(TS-22 - Optional Sentry Integration):** If approved for V1.0, integrate the Sentry SDK (or chosen error tracking service) into `src/main.tsx` or `src/App.tsx`, configured using `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` for production builds only.
* [ ] Execute the deployment to the production environment using the CI/CD pipeline.
* [ ] Conduct post-deployment smoke tests on the live production URL to verify core functionalities.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **CI/CD Pipeline Testing:**
  * Trigger pipeline on PRs/pushes to test build, lint, unit tests, E2E tests execution.
  * Verify successful deployments to staging.
  * Test production deployment trigger.
* **Manual Testing (Post-Deployment):**
  * Perform smoke tests on the live production URL covering:
    * App loads correctly.
    * Anonymous user can log a basic workout.
    * Settings page is accessible, basic settings can be changed.
    * PWA installability from production URL.
    * Offline launch from production URL (after first visit).
  * Verify production manifest and service worker are active and correct using browser dev tools.
  * Run Lighthouse audit on the production URL.
* **Error Reporting Verification (If TS-22 implemented):**
  * Manually trigger a test error in a production-like build (or a staging build with prod Sentry DSN temporarily) and verify it appears in Sentry dashboard.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Focus on pipeline integrity and production environment checks.)_
