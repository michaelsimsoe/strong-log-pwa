# Story 4.3: Program Activation & Management (Multiple Programs)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to activate a created program to start following it, view a list of all my programs (both active and inactive), and be able to manage multiple concurrently active programs, so I can organize my various training routines.

**Context:** This story enables users to manage their library of defined programs, activate them to start tracking progress, and handle multiple active routines simultaneously. It introduces the `ActiveProgramInstance` entity.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a program library view where users can see all their created programs.
* Users must be able to `activate` an inactive program. Activating a program creates an "active instance" of it (`ActiveProgramInstance` in Dexie.js), ready for state tracking.
* Users must be able to `deactivate` (or pause) an active program.
* The system must support multiple concurrently active programs (e.g., a primary strength program and a secondary conditioning program).
* Users should be able to `edit` the definition of an inactive program. (Editing active programs will be restricted in V1.0: only new activations will use the edited definition, as per `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md`).
* Users should be able to `delete` or `archive` programs they no longer need (primarily inactive ones).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can view a list of all their defined programs (`ProgramDefinition`s), with an indicator for active/inactive status (derived from presence of related `ActiveProgramInstance`s).
* AC2: User can select an inactive program and activate it. This creates a new `ActiveProgramInstance` record in Dexie.js with initial state (e.g., `status: 'active'`, `startDate`, `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram: 0`).
* AC3: User can select an active program and deactivate/pause it, updating the status of its `ActiveProgramInstance` in Dexie.js.
* AC4: The system correctly handles and displays multiple concurrently active programs.
* AC5: User can edit the structure/settings of an inactive `ProgramDefinition`. Changes apply to new activations only.
* AC6: User can delete an inactive `ProgramDefinition` (with confirmation). Consideration for what happens if active instances exist (V1.0 may restrict deletion if active instances exist, or orphan them).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/programs/pages/ProgramLibraryPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/programs/components/ProgramListItem.tsx`
    * `src/services/data/programService.ts` (extend for CRUD on `ActiveProgramInstance`, and managing `ProgramDefinition` edits/deletes).
    * `src/services/engines/fryClient.ts` (or similar, to call FRY worker for `activateProgram`, `deactivateProgram`).
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `ActiveProgramInstance` interface and Zod schema from `docs/data-models.md`).
    * `src/services/engines/fry.worker.ts` (Comlink API for activation/deactivation as per `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md`).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md` details FRY worker Comlink API.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Table` or list, `Button`, `Switch`, `AlertDialog`), Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript.
  * Comlink (for interacting with FRY worker).
  * `dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`) for reactive lists.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Comlink calls to FRY worker methods: `activateProgram`, `deactivateProgram`.
  * Dexie.js API for reading `ProgramDefinition`s and `ActiveProgramInstance`s, deleting `ProgramDefinition`s.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ProgramDefinition` (read).
  * `ActiveProgramInstance` (created, updated).
  * Zod schema for `ActiveProgramInstance`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * V1.0 strategy for editing active programs: edits to `ProgramDefinition` apply to new activations. UI should reflect this.
  * Deletion of `ProgramDefinition`: Consider if it should be allowed if active instances exist. For V1.0, simplest might be to prevent deletion if active, or orphan the active instances (FRY worker would then need to handle missing definitions gracefully, e.g., by marking instance as errored). `FRY testplan.md` might imply testing this.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the program library, showing program names, active/inactive status, and actions (Activate/Deactivate, Edit, Delete).
* [ ] Implement fetching and displaying `ProgramDefinition`s using `useLiveQuery`. Determine active status by checking for corresponding `ActiveProgramInstance`s.
* [ ] Implement the client-side logic (`programService.ts` or a new `fryClient.ts`) to call the FRY worker's `activateProgram(programDefinitionId)` method via Comlink when a user activates a program. This worker method will create the `ActiveProgramInstance` in Dexie.js.
* [ ] Implement client-side logic to call FRY worker's `deactivateProgram(activeProgramInstanceId)` method via Comlink to update status.
* [ ] Implement UI and logic for editing an _inactive_ `ProgramDefinition` (reusing UIs from Story 4.1/4.2).
* [ ] Implement UI and logic for deleting an _inactive_ `ProgramDefinition`, including confirmation. Decide and implement handling if active instances exist.
* [ ] Ensure UI can handle and display multiple concurrently active programs.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRY testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `ProgramLibraryPage` and `ProgramListItem` components with mocked program data and statuses.
  * Test `programService.ts` or `fryClient.ts` for calling Comlink methods (mock Comlink).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test activating a program: UI click -> Comlink call to (mocked) FRY worker -> verify worker receives call.
  * Test the V1.0 strategy for editing program definitions (edits only affect new activations).
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Create a program (Story 4.1/4.2). Activate it. Verify it appears as active. Deactivate it. Verify status change.
  * Test having multiple active programs.
  * Edit an inactive program definition, then activate it to ensure new instance uses edited definition.
  * Delete an inactive program.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRY testplan.md` for details)_
