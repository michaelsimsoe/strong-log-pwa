# Story 3.4: Core Rule Evaluation Logic (in Web Worker)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a system, after a user completes a workout, I need to evaluate all their active progression rules against the performance data of that workout within a Web Worker, so that I can determine which rules' conditions have been met without blocking the UI.

**Context:** This is a critical backend story for FRX. It involves setting up the Shared Web Worker, integrating `json-rules-engine`, and implementing the logic to fetch facts from Dexie.js and evaluate rule conditions asynchronously. This work is heavily guided by `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`.

## Detailed Requirements

* The rule evaluation process must occur within a **Shared Web Worker** to prevent blocking the main UI thread.
* Communication between the main thread and the FRX worker will be managed using **Comlink**.
* The FRX worker must have access to **Dexie.js** to fetch workout data and rule definitions.
* The **`json-rules-engine`** library will be initialized and used within the FRX worker for rule evaluation.
* After a workout session is marked "completed" and saved:
  * The engine retrieves all "active" progression rules associated with the exercises performed or the program being followed.
  * For each rule, the engine evaluates its defined conditions against the data from the just-completed workout and relevant historical data (e.g., for "consecutive successes") using asynchronous "fact finders".
  * The engine must accurately interpret condition parameters (exercise, metric, operator, value).
  * The engine records which rules were "triggered" (all conditions met) for which exercises.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: After a workout is completed, the rule evaluation process is triggered automatically (or on demand by application logic calling the worker) within the FRX Shared Web Worker via Comlink.
* AC2: The engine correctly identifies and retrieves all relevant "active" progression rules from Dexie.js within the worker.
* AC3: Conditions based on completion status are evaluated correctly using facts fetched from Dexie.js (e.g., via `fact_lastWorkoutExercisePerformance`).
* AC4: Conditions based on achieved reps/weight against targets are evaluated correctly (e.g., via `fact_lastWorkoutExercisePerformance`).
* AC5: Conditions based on specific rep counts (e.g., last AMRAP set) are evaluated correctly (e.g., via `fact_lastWorkoutExercisePerformance.lastSet`).
* AC6: Conditions based on historical data (e.g., consecutive successes/failures) are evaluated correctly by accessing past workout logs and `AppliedProgressionLog` via asynchronous fact finders (e.g., `fact_exerciseHistoricalStats`).
* AC7: The engine outputs a clear result for each rule evaluation (e.g., triggered events/actions) and for which exercise(s) it applies, which can be processed in Story 3.5.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create:
    * `src/services/engines/frx.worker.ts` (Main FRX worker script)
    * `src/services/engines/frx/frxFactFinders.ts` (Defines fact resolution logic)
    * `src/services/engines/frx/frxLogic.ts` (Contains `evaluateRulesForWorkout` and other core logic)
    * `src/services/engines/comlink.setup.ts` (If not already existing, for Comlink proxy setup)
  * Files to Modify:
    * `vite.config.ts` (for Shared Web Worker bundling, ensure Comlink compatibility if needed).
    * Application logic that triggers FRX evaluation (e.g., after workout save in `workoutService.ts`).
  * _(Hint: `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md` provides detailed structure and conceptual code for these files)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Shared Web Workers
  * Comlink: `~4.4.x`
  * `json-rules-engine`: `~6.1.x`
  * Dexie.js (accessible in worker)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list, `docs/architecture.md` for worker strategy)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Comlink API for main thread-worker communication.
  * `json-rules-engine` API (`Engine.addRule()`, `Engine.addFact()`, `Engine.run()`).
  * Dexie.js API for data fetching within worker.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ProgressionRule` (from Dexie.js).
  * `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet` (from Dexie.js).
  * Fact structures (e.g., `LastWorkoutExercisePerformanceFact`, `ExerciseHistoricalStatsFact` as defined in `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`).
  * Data contract for Comlink communication (input parameters like `workoutLogId`, output like `TriggeredAction[]` from `FRX Implementation Plan.md`).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Worker logic must be self-contained or use transferable data.
  * Ensure robust error handling within the worker and propagate errors appropriately via Comlink.
  * Fact finders must be asynchronous and handle cases where data might be missing.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for general standards, and `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md` for worker specific structure)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **(Engine Infrastructure - Prerequisite TS-11):** Configure Vite for Shared Web Worker bundling. Implement `src/services/engines/comlink.setup.ts` to manage Comlink proxies for main thread access to worker services.
* [ ] **(Engine Infrastructure - Prerequisite TS-11):** Implement the initial Shared Web Worker script `src/services/engines/frx.worker.ts` and expose its main class/object via Comlink as outlined in `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`.
* [ ] **(Engine Infrastructure - Prerequisite TS-12):** Ensure Dexie.js instance (`db`) from `src/services/data/db.ts` is correctly initialized and accessible within `frx.worker.ts`.
* [ ] Initialize `json-rules-engine` `Engine` instance within `frx.worker.ts`.
* [ ] Implement asynchronous 'fact finders' in `src/services/engines/frx/frxFactFinders.ts` for `json-rules-engine`'s almanac to dynamically fetch performance data (e.g., `fact_lastWorkoutExercisePerformance`, `fact_exerciseHistoricalStats`) from Dexie.js. Register these with the engine.
* [ ] Implement the main rule evaluation logic (`evaluateRulesForWorkout` in `src/services/engines/frx/frxLogic.ts`) within the worker. This function will fetch active rules, use `engine.run()` with appropriate parameters for fact finders, and collect triggered events/actions.
* [ ] Define and implement the data contract (and any necessary Zod schemas) for messages passed to the FRX worker (e.g., `{ workoutLogId: string }`) and results returned (e.g., `Promise<TriggeredAction[]>`).
* [ ] Implement the main thread logic to call the FRX worker's `evaluateAndApplyProgressions` method via Comlink after a workout is saved.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRX testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test individual fact finders in `frxFactFinders.ts` with mocked Dexie.js data to ensure they return correct fact structures.
  * Test the `evaluateRulesForWorkout` logic with mocked `json-rules-engine` and fact finders to ensure correct rule processing and event collection.
  * Test error handling within the worker.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest, potentially with Dexie.js in-memory/mocked for worker context):**
  * Test the FRX worker's Comlink interface: send a `workoutLogId`, ensure the worker runs, interacts with (mocked or simple real) Dexie.js, and `json-rules-engine` to produce expected triggered actions based on predefined rules and data.
  * Test evaluation of rules with various condition types (Completion, Reps vs Target, Specific Rep Count, Consecutive Success/Failure) using a controlled Dexie.js state.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * While direct worker output is hard to assert in E2E, these tests will be crucial for Story 3.5 and 3.6 by verifying that workout plan adjustments (the _outcome_ of FRX evaluation and application) occur correctly after logging specific workouts that should trigger predefined rules.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRX testplan.md` for comprehensive FRX testing strategies)_
