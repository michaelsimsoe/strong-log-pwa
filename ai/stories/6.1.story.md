# Story 6.1: Primary Dashboard - "Today's Focus" & Quick Actions Implementation

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user launching the app, I want to see a clear "Today's Focus" section on my dashboard that intelligently suggests my next workout and provides quick action buttons, so I can immediately understand what to do or easily navigate to other key tasks.

**Context:** This story implements the main action-oriented section of the primary dashboard. It aims to provide users with immediate, context-aware suggestions for their next training activity by integrating with the FRY engine's outputs.

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement the "Today's Focus" / "Next Up" section on the primary dashboard screen.
* Display the system-suggested next workout from an active program (if applicable) with a "Start This Workout" button. This data will be fetched from the FRY engine.
* Provide clearly accessible options to "Choose Other Program Workout" or "Start Ad-hoc Workout" (from templates/empty).
* If no workout is immediately projected (e.g., no active programs or user is between scheduled days), this section should offer intelligent alternative actions (e.g., "Start next in Program X," "Repeat last workout," "Start Ad-hoc").
* Implement Quick Action Buttons: "Start Empty Workout," "Browse Programs/Templates," "View Full Analytics".
* Data displayed in this view/component will primarily be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)** to ensure the UI stays in sync with local data, particularly for program state summaries that might inform which program's "next workout" to fetch from FRY.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The dashboard correctly displays the projected next workout (e.g., name, day tag) from an active program, if one is due, based on data fetched via the FRY engine's Comlink service.
* AC2: The "Start This Workout" button correctly launches the suggested program workout, pre-filled with the FRY-generated plan.
* AC3: User can easily access and use the "Choose Other Program Workout" option, leading to program selection (Epic 4 UI).
* AC4: User can easily access and use the "Start Ad-hoc Workout" option, leading to template selection (Epic 1 UI) or an empty workout.
* AC5: The Quick Action buttons ("Start Empty Workout," "Browse Programs/Templates," "View Full Analytics") are present and navigate to their respective sections/functions.
* AC6: The "Today's Focus" section provides contextually relevant alternative suggestions if no specific program workout is immediately projected by FRY.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/dashboard/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` (Main container for dashboard sections)
    * `src/features/dashboard/components/TodayFocus.tsx`
    * `src/features/dashboard/components/QuickActions.tsx`
    * `src/services/engines/fryClient.ts` (or similar on main thread to call FRY worker's `getNextWorkoutPlan` and `getProgramScheduleView` via Comlink).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/services/engines/fry.worker.ts` (for FRY Comlink API details from Epic 4).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (for `GeneratedWorkoutPlan`, `ActiveProgramInstance` to understand what `useLiveQuery` might fetch for context).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure. This story relies on FRY engine outputs from Epic 4.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Button`, `Card`)
  * Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`): For reactive fetching of `ActiveProgramInstance` summaries or other contextual data.
  * Comlink: For interacting with the FRY worker.
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Main thread application logic will call FRY worker's `getNextWorkoutPlan(activeProgramInstanceId)` and potentially `getProgramScheduleView(activeProgramInstanceId)` via Comlink to get the suggested workout and its projected date.
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch `ActiveProgramInstance` list to determine which program is "next" or most relevant if multiple are active.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `GeneratedWorkoutPlan` (received from FRY worker).
  * `ActiveProgramInstance` (summary data fetched via `useLiveQuery` to provide context to FRY calls).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Logic for "intelligent alternative actions" should be clearly defined (e.g., based on most recently active program, or program with earliest next projected date).
  * Ensure efficient use of `useLiveQuery` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Develop the UI layout for the "Today's Focus" section on `DashboardPage.tsx`.
* [ ] Implement logic (likely using `useLiveQuery` on `ActiveProgramInstances` and then calling the FRY worker via a `fryClient.ts` service) to:
  * Identify the most relevant active program(s).
  * Fetch the system-suggested `GeneratedWorkoutPlan` and its `projectedDate` from the FRY worker for the primary suggested workout.
  * Determine appropriate alternative actions if no workout is immediately projected.
* [ ] Display the suggested workout details and the "Start This Workout" button. Implement navigation to start this specific workout (passing the `GeneratedWorkoutPlan` to the logging screen from Epic 4.6).
* [ ] Implement the "Choose Other Program Workout" button and its navigation to the program selection/Browse UI (from Epic 4).
* [ ] Implement the "Start Ad-hoc Workout" button and its navigation to workout template selection or an empty workout state (from Epic 1).
* [ ] Implement the `QuickActions.tsx` component with buttons for "Start Empty Workout," "Browse Programs/Templates," "View Full Analytics" and their respective navigations.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `TodayFocus.tsx` and `QuickActions.tsx` components with mocked data (e.g., mocked FRY responses, mocked program states) to verify correct rendering of suggestions and button functionalities.
  * Test the logic for determining "intelligent alternative actions."
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test interaction between `TodayFocus.tsx` and mocked `fryClient.ts` service to ensure correct fetching and display of suggested workouts.
  * Test `useLiveQuery` hooks to ensure they provide reactive updates to the component from mock Dexie data.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Scenario 1 (Active Program with Due Workout): Activate a program (Epic 4), ensure FRY projects a next workout. Navigate to dashboard, verify "Today's Focus" shows this workout. Click "Start This Workout" and verify it navigates to the correct logging screen.
  * Scenario 2 (No Active Program / No Due Workout): Ensure appropriate alternative actions are displayed. Test quick action buttons navigate correctly.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
