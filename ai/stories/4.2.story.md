# Story 4.2: Program Definition - Frequency & Progression Rules

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user defining a program, I want to specify its target training frequency (e.g., 3 times a week) and assign specific progression rules to the program or individual exercises within it, so the program can intelligently guide my advancement.

**Context:** This story enhances the program definition capabilities from Story 4.1 by allowing users to set a target frequency for their program and link existing Progression Rules (from Epic 3) to it. This makes programs more dynamic and ties them into the automated progression system.

## Detailed Requirements

* When creating or editing a program, allow the user to specify a `target frequency` (e.g., "3 workouts per week," "every other day").
* Allow the user to link existing Progression Rules (from Epic 3 / FRX) to:
  * The program as a whole (global rules for that program).
  * Specific workout sessions within the program.
  * Specific exercises within a workout session in the program.
* Define precedence if multiple rules (global, program-level, exercise-level) could apply to an exercise (Note: Actual precedence logic is handled by FRX engine, this story ensures data for it is captured).
* The structure for linking `ProgressionRuleIds` and their scopes, as well as `targetFrequency`, within the `ProgramDefinition` must also be covered by the **Zod schema** for `ProgramDefinition`.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can set a target frequency for the program (e.g., number of workouts per week, or selecting "every X days" and specifying X).
* AC2: User can browse their existing progression rules (created in Epic 3) and select one or more to link to the program.
* AC3: When linking a rule, user can specify its scope: entire program, a specific workout day/session in the sequence, or a specific exercise within a specific workout day/session.
* AC4: The program's target frequency and its associated progression rules (including their `ruleId` and `scope` information) are validated by the `ProgramDefinition` Zod schema and saved with the program definition.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/programs/pages/CreateProgramPage.tsx` (or `EditProgramPage.tsx`) (extend from Story 4.1).
    * `src/features/programs/components/ProgramSettingsForm.tsx` (new or extended component for frequency and rule linking).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (update `ProgramDefinition` interface and Zod schema for `targetFrequency` and `linkedProgressionRuleIds`).
    * `src/services/data/programService.ts` (update to handle saving these new fields).
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/features/rules/components/RulePicker.tsx` (a reusable component to browse and select from `progressionRules` table in Dexie).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` & `docs/data-models.md` for `ProgramDefinition.targetFrequency` and `ProgramDefinition.linkedProgressionRuleIds` structure.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Select` for frequency type, `Input` for value, `Dialog`/`Popover` for rule picker), Zod, Dexie.js, TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API to fetch `progressionRules` for the rule picker.
  * Dexie.js API to save the extended `ProgramDefinition`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ProgramDefinition.targetFrequency`: `{ type: 'perWeek' | 'everyXDays'; value: number; }`.
  * `ProgramDefinition.linkedProgressionRuleIds`: `Array<{ ruleId: string; scope: 'program' | 'workoutInProgram' | 'exerciseInProgram'; scopeIdentifier?: string; }>`. `scopeIdentifier` could be workout `orderInProgram` or `exerciseDefinitionId` within a specific workout.
  * Update Zod schema for `ProgramDefinition` to include these fields.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * UI for rule linking should clearly show the scope hierarchy.
  * Zod validation must be comprehensive for the new structures.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Add UI elements to the program definition form for setting `targetFrequency` (type and value).
* [ ] Design and implement a UI for Browse and selecting existing `ProgressionRule`s (from Dexie.js) to link to the program. This might involve a modal or popover with a searchable list of rules.
* [ ] Implement UI for specifying the scope of each linked rule (program-wide, specific workout session, specific exercise within a session). This will require context of the program structure being built.
* [ ] Update the `ProgramDefinition` TypeScript interface and Zod schema in `src/types/data.types.ts` to include `targetFrequency` and `linkedProgressionRuleIds` as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Update `programService.ts` to correctly save these new fields as part of the `ProgramDefinition` object, ensuring validation by the updated Zod schema.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRY testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for frequency selection and rule linking/scoping.
  * Test updated Zod schema for `ProgramDefinition` with frequency and rule linking data.
  * Test `programService.ts` updates for saving these new fields.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test adding frequency and linking rules (with different scopes) to a program definition and saving it. Verify correct data storage in Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Create a program, set its frequency, link several FRX rules with different scopes (program, workout, exercise). Save and verify.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRY testplan.md` for details)_
