# Story 6.3: Workout Log/History View - List & Filtering

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a chronological list of all my past workout sessions and be able to filter and search this history, so I can easily find specific workouts.

**Context:** This story implements the list view for workout history, providing users with access to their past training data. It includes essential filtering and search capabilities for easy navigation.

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement a dedicated screen for workout history/log.
* Display workouts chronologically (newest first by default).
* Each list item should show key summary info (e.g., date, program name if applicable from `WorkoutLog.programDefinitionId`, main exercises or workout name from `WorkoutLog.name`).
* Implement filtering options: by date range, by program name (if part of a program), and potentially by exercises performed (requires searching `LoggedSet`s linked to `WorkoutLog`s).
* Implement a search functionality to find workouts containing specific exercise names (from `LoggedSet.exerciseDefinitionId` linked to `WorkoutLog`).
* Data displayed in this view/component will primarily be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can access a screen displaying a list of all saved `WorkoutLog` sessions, fetched reactively using `useLiveQuery`.
* AC2: Workouts are displayed in reverse chronological order by `WorkoutLog.startTime` by default.
* AC3: User can successfully filter the workout list by a specified date range.
* AC4: User can successfully filter the workout list by `programDefinitionId` (program name would require joining/mapping).
* AC5: User can search for workouts containing a specific exercise name (by searching related `LoggedSet`s and then showing parent `WorkoutLog`s), and the list updates accordingly.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/history/pages/WorkoutHistoryPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/history/components/WorkoutHistoryListItem.tsx`
    * `src/features/history/components/WorkoutHistoryFilters.tsx`
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (`WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`, `ProgramDefinition` for program name).
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts` (or direct Dexie queries in `useLiveQuery`).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Table` or list components, `Input` for search, `DatePicker` for date range), Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`, TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch `WorkoutLog` records.
  * Dexie.js querying capabilities for filtering by date (`WorkoutLog.startTime`), `programDefinitionId`.
  * For searching by exercise name:
    * Fetch `ExerciseDefinition` matching the name to get its ID.
    * Query `LoggedSet`s for that `exerciseDefinitionId`.
    * Get unique `workoutLogId`s from these sets.
    * Fetch `WorkoutLog`s matching these IDs. This multi-step query needs to be efficient.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `WorkoutLog` (primary entity for listing).
  * `LoggedSet` (for filtering/searching by exercise).
  * `ProgramDefinition` (to display program name if `WorkoutLog.programDefinitionId` is present).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Queries for filtering and searching, especially those involving joins or multiple steps (like search by exercise name), must be optimized for performance with potentially large datasets.
  * Pagination or virtual scrolling should be considered if workout history can become very long, though not explicitly required by this story for V1.0.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the workout history list, including display of summary info for each workout and controls for filtering (date range, program) and searching (exercise name).
* [ ] Implement `useLiveQuery` hook to fetch `WorkoutLog`s from Dexie.js, sorted by `startTime` descending.
* [ ] Implement filter logic within the `useLiveQuery` query or by processing its results for:
  * Date range (filtering `WorkoutLog.startTime`).
  * Program (filtering by `WorkoutLog.programDefinitionId`; map ID to program name for display).
* [ ] Implement search logic:
  * Allow user to type an exercise name.
  * Query `ExerciseDefinition`s for matching names to get IDs.
  * Query `LoggedSet`s for these `exerciseDefinitionId`s to find relevant `workoutLogId`s.
  * Filter the main `WorkoutLog` list based on these `workoutLogId`s.
* [ ] Implement the `WorkoutHistoryListItem.tsx` to display summary information for each workout.
* [ ] Ensure navigation from a list item to the detailed workout view (Story 6.4).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `WorkoutHistoryFilters.tsx` component for interaction and state changes.
  * Test helper functions for query construction or data processing for filters/search with mock data.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `WorkoutHistoryPage.tsx` with `useLiveQuery` and seeded Dexie.js data. Verify:
    * Correct initial list rendering and order.
    * Date range filter works correctly.
    * Program filter works correctly.
    * Exercise name search correctly filters the list.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Log several workouts (some in programs, some ad-hoc, with various exercises).
  * Navigate to history page. Verify default sort order.
  * Test date range filter. Test program filter. Test exercise search.
  * Verify clicking a workout navigates to its detail view (Story 6.4).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
