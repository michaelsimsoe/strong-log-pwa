# Story 1.2: Client-Side Database Setup (IndexedDB with Dexie.js & Zod)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need IndexedDB to be set up using Dexie.js with an initial schema covering all V1.0 data structures and Zod for validation, so that user data can be stored locally, persist offline, and maintain integrity.

**Context:** This story establishes the client-side persistence layer, which is fundamental for StrongLog's offline-first capabilities and data storage for all application features. It ensures data integrity through schema definition and runtime validation using Zod.

## Detailed Requirements

* Initialize IndexedDB as the primary client-side database using **Dexie.js** as the wrapper library for all interactions.
* The initial V1.0 Dexie.js schema definition must include all core entities identified in `docs/data-models.md` (Version 0.1) (UserSettings, ExerciseDefinition, WorkoutLog, LoggedSet, WorkoutTemplate, WorkoutTemplateExerciseInstance, ProgramDefinition, ActiveProgramInstance, ProgressionRule, UserGoal, UserBodyweightLog, AppliedProgressionLog) with their specified properties and indexes. This means for Epic 1, the schema for `userSettings`, `exerciseDefinitions`, and `workoutLogs` (and `loggedSets` as it's intrinsically linked to `workoutLogs`) will be immediately utilized, while others are defined for future epics.
* **Zod schemas** must be defined for these core data model interfaces to ensure runtime data integrity when interacting with Dexie.js or other parts of the system.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Dexie.js is integrated, and the IndexedDB database "StrongLogDB" is created successfully on app initialization.
* AC2: The V1 Dexie.js schema is defined in `src/services/data/db.ts` covering all entities from `docs/data-models.md` (Version 0.1), with appropriate key paths and initial indexes for entities used in Epic 1 (`userSettings`, `exerciseDefinitions`, `workoutLogs`, `loggedSets`).
* AC3: Zod schemas are defined for at least `UserSettings`, `ExerciseDefinition`, `WorkoutLog`, and `LoggedSet` data model interfaces and are used for validation during relevant CRUD operations.
* AC4: Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) can be performed programmatically on the `userSettings`, `exerciseDefinitions`, and `workoutLogs`/`loggedSets` stores using Dexie.js, with Zod validation applied.
* AC5: Data persists in IndexedDB across browser sessions and app restarts.
* AC6: Database versioning is implemented using Dexie.js's `version().stores().upgrade()` mechanism.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/services/data/db.ts` (Dexie.js instance and schema definition)
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (or co-located with feature models, containing Zod schemas and TypeScript interfaces from `docs/data-models.md`)
    * Wrapper functions/services for CRUD operations (e.g., `src/services/dataService.ts` or feature-specific services).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout & `docs/data-models.md` for schema details)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Dexie.js: `~3.2.x` or `~4.0.x` (ensure chosen version compatibility, v4 for more modern features if stable)
  * Zod: `~3.23.x`
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for database definition (`Dexie.version().stores()`, `db.table()`) and CRUD operations (`table.add()`, `table.get()`, `table.update()`, `table.delete()`, `table.bulkAdd()`, etc.).

* **Data Structures:**
  * TypeScript interfaces and Dexie.js table definitions for all entities in `docs/data-models.md` (Version 0.1).
  * Zod schemas mirroring these TypeScript interfaces.
  * Key entities for immediate use in Epic 1: `UserSettings`, `ExerciseDefinition`, `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Use `async/await` for all Dexie.js operations.
  * Validate data with Zod schemas before writing to Dexie.js and potentially after reading, if strictness is required.
  * Follow Dexie.js best practices for schema migrations.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards & `docs/data-models.md` for schema details)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Install and configure Dexie.js (`dexie` package).
* [ ] Install Zod (`zod` package).
* [ ] Define the V1 Dexie.js schema in `src/services/data/db.ts` covering all entities from `docs/data-models.md` (Version 0.1), including primary keys (e.g., `++id` or UUIDs) and all necessary indexes as specified in `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Implement database versioning using Dexie.js's `db.version(X).stores({...})` for schema definition. Include an `.upgrade()` if any data migration logic is needed even for V1 (usually not, but good practice to know).
* [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces and corresponding Zod schemas for all core data model entities from `docs/data-models.md` (Version 0.1) (e.g., in `src/types/data.types.ts` or co-located).
* [ ] Implement basic wrapper functions or services around Dexie.js for common CRUD operations for Epic 1 entities (`UserSettings`, `ExerciseDefinition`, `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`), incorporating Zod validation before writing data.
* [ ] Write unit tests for these wrapper functions/services to verify CRUD operations and Zod validation logic.
* [ ] Test basic CRUD operations and data persistence across browser sessions manually for the initial entities.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL if UI involved, primarily Vitest for DB logic):**
  * Test Dexie.js schema definition: Ensure database and tables are created as expected.
  * Test Zod schema validations for `UserSettings`, `ExerciseDefinition`, `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet` with valid and invalid data.
  * Test CRUD wrapper functions: Mock Dexie.js calls to test the logic of wrapper functions, including Zod validation steps.
  * Test data persistence across mocked sessions if possible, or rely on integration/manual tests.
  * Test database versioning and upgrade logic if any complex upgrades are defined (though likely simple for V1 init).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test actual Dexie.js CRUD operations on an in-memory or temporary IndexedDB instance. Verify data is written, read, updated, and deleted correctly.
  * Verify Zod validation integration with actual database operations.
* **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  * Use browser developer tools to inspect IndexedDB structure and data for "StrongLogDB".
  * Manually test data persistence by reloading the app or closing/reopening the browser.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach & `docs/data-models.md` for schema expectations)_
