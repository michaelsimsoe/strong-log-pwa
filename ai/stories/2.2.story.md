# Story 2.2: Logging AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) for Time (Utilizing Integrated Workout Timer)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log a set as "AMRAP for Time" by specifying the weight, a target time duration, and then recording the maximum repetitions achieved within that time, using a precise and user-friendly integrated timer.

**Context:** This story introduces another advanced set type, AMRAP for Time, which requires integration with the Integrated Workout Timer (to be developed in Story 2.6). It allows users to track performance on sets limited by a specific time duration.

## Detailed Requirements

* Allow a set to be designated as "AMRAP for Time".
* User must be able to input `weight` used.
* User must be able to input the `target time duration` for the AMRAP set (e.g., 60 seconds). This duration will be used by the **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** in countdown mode.
* User must be able to input the `achieved repetitions` within the duration.
* The system should store this set clearly identified as an AMRAP (time) set.
* The data structure for this set type (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`) must be validated using its corresponding **Zod schema** before being saved to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select "AMRAP for Time" as a set type.
* AC2: User can input and save weight and target time duration for the set.
* AC3: The **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** is invoked for this set, configured in countdown mode with the specified target duration.
* AC4: User can easily start the countdown timer when ready to begin the set.
* AC5: User can input and save achieved repetitions after the timed period.
* AC6: The saved log accurately reflects the set as AMRAP (time) with weight, target duration, and achieved reps, and this data passes Zod validation upon saving.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx` (or similar, to add set type selection and fields for AMRAP Time).
    * `src/features/logging/hooks/useActiveWorkout.ts` (to handle new set type state).
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts` (to handle saving `AmrapTimeSet`).
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `AmrapTimeSet` interface and Zod schema from `docs/data-models.md`).
    * `src/features/logging/components/IntegratedWorkoutTimer.tsx` (from Story 2.6 - this story depends on it).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` & `docs/data-models.md` for `LoggedSet` union and `AmrapTimeSet` details)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Select`, `Input`)
  * Dexie.js
  * Zod
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6 functionality)
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving `LoggedSet` with `setType: 'amrapTime'`.
  * API of the Integrated Workout Timer component (from Story 2.6) to start countdown.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `LoggedSet` union type, specifically the `AmrapTimeSet` interface:

        ```typescript
        export interface AmrapTimeSet extends BaseSet {
          setType: 'amrapTime';
          targetWeightKg?: number; // Planned weight
          targetDurationSecs: number; // Planned duration
          loggedWeightKg: number;
          loggedReps: number; // Achieved reps within duration
          loggedDurationSecs?: number; // Actual duration if different
        }
        ```

  * Corresponding Zod schema for `AmrapTimeSet`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Requires careful integration with the Timer component from Story 2.6.
  * Ensure Zod schema for `AmrapTimeSet` validates inputs like `targetDurationSecs`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI in `SetInputRow.tsx` (or equivalent) for "AMRAP for Time" set type, including inputs for weight, target duration, and achieved reps.
* [ ] Integrate controls to invoke and use the **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** in countdown mode, configured with the `targetDurationSecs`.
* [ ] Update active workout state management to handle `AmrapTimeSet` data.
* [ ] Ensure `AmrapTimeSet` interface and Zod schema are correctly defined as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Modify `workoutService.ts` to save `LoggedSet` objects with `setType: 'amrapTime'`, applying Zod validation.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. This story heavily depends on Story 2.6 (Timer).

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for AMRAP (time) set logging: Input fields, interaction with a mocked Timer component.
  * Test Zod schema for `AmrapTimeSet`.
  * Test `workoutService.ts` logic for saving AMRAP (time) sets.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test interaction between logging UI, (mocked or partially real) Timer, and saving data to Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Start workout, add exercise, log AMRAP (time) set, use timer, input reps, finish workout. Verify data in history (when Epic 6.4 is done).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
