# Story 5.5: In-Workout Goal Visibility (Motivational Context)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user performing an exercise, I want to easily see if there's an active goal related to that specific exercise, so I can draw motivation and context during my set.

**Context:** This story aims to enhance user motivation and focus during workouts by providing contextual information about relevant active goals directly within the workout logging screen.

## Detailed Requirements

* When a user is on the active workout logging screen for a specific exercise (UI from Epic 1 & 2):
  * If there's an active "Specific Lift Target" goal for that exercise (e.g., a 5RM goal for Bench Press), display a non-intrusive reminder of that goal (e.g., "Goal: 80kg x 5 reps").
* This should be for informational/motivational purposes and not clutter the primary logging interface.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When logging sets for an exercise that is linked to an active "Specific Lift Target" goal, a summary of that goal (e.g., target weight/reps) is visible on the logging screen.
* AC2: This display is unobtrusive and does not interfere with the primary logging inputs and actions.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/pages/ActiveWorkoutPage.tsx` or `src/features/logging/components/ExerciseLogCard.tsx` (to include the goal display logic).
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/features/goals/components/InWorkoutGoalReminder.tsx` (optional component for this display).
    * `src/services/data/goalService.ts` (to fetch relevant active goals).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, TypeScript.
  * Dexie.js (to query `userGoals`).
  * `dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`) for reactive goal data.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API to query `userGoals` table by `exerciseDefinitionId` and `status: 'active'`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserGoal` (reading `targetWeightKg`, `targetReps` for "Specific Lift Target" type).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The query for relevant goals should be efficient.
  * UI display should be minimal and clearly a secondary piece of information.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design how to subtly display relevant "Specific Lift Target" goal information (e.g., "Goal: 80kg x 5 reps") on the workout logging screen when an exercise with such a goal is active. This might be a small text line or badge near the exercise name.
* [ ] In the workout logging component (`ActiveWorkoutPage.tsx` or `ExerciseLogCard.tsx`), when an exercise is being logged, implement logic to:
  * Fetch active "Specific Lift Target" goals from Dexie.js (using `goalService.ts` or `useLiveQuery`) that match the current `exerciseDefinitionId`.
  * If a relevant goal exists, display its target (e.g., weight and reps).
* [ ] Ensure the display is unobtrusive and does not interfere with logging actions.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRZ testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the component responsible for displaying the in-workout goal reminder with mocked goal data (goal present, goal not present, different goal targets).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * With a goal seeded in Dexie.js for a specific exercise, test that the workout logging UI for that exercise correctly fetches and displays the goal reminder.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Create a "Specific Lift Target" goal for "Bench Press". Start a workout, add "Bench Press". Verify the goal reminder (e.g., "Goal: 100kg x 5 reps") appears on the logging screen for Bench Press. Log another exercise without a goal and verify no reminder appears.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRZ testplan.md` for details)_
