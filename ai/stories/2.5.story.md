# Story 2.5: Defining and Logging Drop Sets

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to define and log a "Drop Set" for an exercise, specifying the initial weight/reps and then quickly logging subsequent sub-sets with reduced weight performed back-to-back, so I can track this intensity technique.

**Context:** This story adds support for Drop Sets, another advanced training technique involving minimal rest between sub-sets of decreasing weight. It requires an efficient UI for quick logging of subsequent drops.

## Detailed Requirements

* Allow an exercise block to be designated as a "Drop Set".
* User defines the `initial weight` and `target/achieved reps` for the first sub-set.
* After completing a sub-set, the UI must allow for quick input of the `new (reduced) weight` and `achieved reps` for the next sub-set, minimizing time between entries. The **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** can be used to time brief transitions if desired by the user, though typically drop sets have minimal rest.
* The system should allow for an arbitrary number of drops until the user indicates the drop set sequence is complete.
* The system must store the entire drop set sequence, including weight/reps for each sub-set. The `groupKey` and `level` fields in the `LoggedSet` model (specifically for `DropSet` type or standard sets part of a drop set) will be used.
* The data structure for each sub-set (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`) must be validated using its corresponding **Zod schema** before being saved to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select "Drop Set" as a type for an exercise block.
* AC2: User can log the initial weight and reps for the first part of the drop set.
* AC3: After logging a sub-set, user can quickly initiate logging for the next drop with minimal clicks.
* AC4: User can indicate the end of the drop set sequence.
* AC5: The saved workout log accurately reflects the entire drop set sequence with weight/reps for each part, with sub-sets correctly linked (using `groupKey` and `level`) and data passing Zod validation upon saving.
* AC6: The **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** can be optionally used for timing brief transitions between drop sub-sets.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx` (or a new `DropSetLogger.tsx`).
    * `src/features/logging/components/DropSubSetInput.tsx`.
    * `src/features/logging/hooks/useActiveWorkout.ts`.
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts`.
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `DropSet` interface and Zod schema from `docs/data-models.md`).
    * `src/features/logging/components/IntegratedWorkoutTimer.tsx` (from Story 2.6).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` & `docs/data-models.md` for `LoggedSet` union, `DropSet` type, and use of `groupKey` and `level`)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript.
  * Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving multiple `LoggedSet` records (each sub-set of the drop set) with a common `groupKey`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `LoggedSet` union type, specifically the `DropSet` interface. `docs/data-models.md` defines `DropSet` as:

        ```typescript
        export interface DropSet extends BaseSet {
          setType: 'dropSet';
          groupKey?: string; // UUID to link parts of a drop set
          level?: number; 
          targetWeightKg?: number; // Initial target (can be for first part)
          targetReps?: number;   // Initial target (can be for first part)
          loggedWeightKg: number;
          loggedReps: number;
        }
        ```

      Each sub-set will be an instance of this `DropSet` type (or similar), sharing a `groupKey`.
  * Corresponding Zod schema for `DropSet` (or the chosen sub-set structure).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * UI must be optimized for rapid logging of subsequent drops.
  * `groupKey` and `level` are crucial for linking drop sub-sets.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for efficiently logging drop sets, allowing quick addition of new drops and input of weight/reps.
* [ ] Implement logic to generate a unique `groupKey` for each drop set block and assign sequential `level` numbers to its sub-sets.
* [ ] Ensure `DropSet` interface and Zod schema are correctly defined/used as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Modify `workoutService.ts` to save multiple `LoggedSet` records (typed as `DropSet` or similar) for each sub-set, ensuring they share the same `groupKey` and have correct `level` values. Apply Zod validation to each sub-set.
* [ ] Optionally integrate the **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** for timing transitions if the user chooses.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. This story may depend on Story 2.6 (Timer).

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for logging drop sets, focusing on efficient addition of sub-sets.
  * Test Zod schema for `DropSet` (or chosen sub-set structure).
  * Test `workoutService.ts` logic for saving drop sets.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test logging a full drop set sequence (e.g., 3 drops) and verify correct storage in Dexie.js with linked `groupKey`.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Start workout, add exercise, log a drop set with multiple drops, finish workout. Verify data in history (when Epic 6.4 is done).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
