# Story 2.1: Logging AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) for Reps

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log a set as "AMRAP for Reps" by specifying the weight used and then recording the maximum number of repetitions I achieved, so that I can accurately track my performance on effort-based sets.

**Context:** This story extends the basic workout logging (Epic 1) by introducing the first type of advanced set: AMRAP for Reps. This allows users to track sets performed to failure for repetitions, a common practice in strength training.

## Detailed Requirements

* When logging an exercise, allow a set to be designated as "AMRAP for Reps".
* The user must be able to input the `weight` used for the AMRAP set.
* The user must be able to input the `achieved repetitions`.
* The system should store this set clearly identified as an AMRAP (reps) set.
* The data structure for this set type (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`) must be validated using its corresponding **Zod schema** before being saved to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select "AMRAP for Reps" as a set type for an exercise during workout logging.
* AC2: User can input and save the weight for the AMRAP (reps) set.
* AC3: User can input and save the number of repetitions achieved for the AMRAP (reps) set.
* AC4: The saved workout log accurately reflects the set as an AMRAP (reps) set with its weight and achieved reps, and this data passes Zod validation upon saving.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx` (or similar component from Story 1.5, to add set type selection and fields for AMRAP Reps).
    * `src/features/logging/hooks/useActiveWorkout.ts` (or similar state management for active workout, to handle new set type).
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts` (to handle saving `AmrapRepsSet` variant of `LoggedSet`).
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `AmrapRepsSet` interface and Zod schema are defined as per `docs/data-models.md`).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure & `docs/data-models.md` for `LoggedSet` union and `AmrapRepsSet` details)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Select` for set type, `Input` for weight/reps)
  * Dexie.js: (from Story 1.2)
  * Zod: (for `AmrapRepsSet` schema from Story 1.2/`docs/data-models.md`)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving the `LoggedSet` with `setType: 'amrapReps'`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `LoggedSet` union type, specifically the `AmrapRepsSet` interface:

        ```typescript
        export interface AmrapRepsSet extends BaseSet {
          setType: 'amrapReps';
          targetWeightKg?: number; // Planned weight (optional if just logging achieved)
          loggedWeightKg: number;
          loggedReps: number; // Achieved reps
        }
        ```

  * Corresponding Zod schema for `AmrapRepsSet`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Extend the workout logging UI (from Story 1.5) to be flexible for different set types.
  * Ensure the Zod schema for `AmrapRepsSet` correctly validates `loggedWeightKg` and `loggedReps` as positive numbers.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI modifications in the workout logging screen (`SetInputRow.tsx` or equivalent) to allow selection of "AMRAP for Reps" set type.
* [ ] Add input fields for `weight` and `achieved repetitions` specific to this set type.
* [ ] Update active workout state management to accommodate `AmrapRepsSet` data.
* [ ] Ensure the `AmrapRepsSet` interface and its Zod schema are correctly defined and available as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Modify `workoutService.ts` (or equivalent) to handle saving `LoggedSet` objects with `setType: 'amrapReps'`, ensuring Zod validation for the `AmrapRepsSet` structure is applied before writing to Dexie.js.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for AMRAP (reps) set logging: Selecting set type, inputting weight and reps.
  * Test Zod schema for `AmrapRepsSet` with valid and invalid data.
  * Test `workoutService.ts` logic for saving AMRAP (reps) sets, including Zod validation (mock Dexie.js).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test adding an AMRAP (reps) set to a workout, saving it, and retrieving it from Dexie.js to verify correct storage.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Start a workout, add an exercise, log an AMRAP (reps) set with specific weight and reps, finish workout. Verify data appears correctly in workout history (when Epic 6.4 is done).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
