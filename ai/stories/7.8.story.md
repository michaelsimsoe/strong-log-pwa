# Story 7.8: User Data Deletion (Local & Cloud)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the ability to delete my data, both locally from my device and, if I have an account and have opted into sync, from the cloud servers, ensuring my right to be forgotten.

**Context:** This story implements data deletion functionalities, respecting user privacy and data ownership, including GDPR considerations for users with synced accounts.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide an option for anonymous users to delete all their locally stored StrongLog data from IndexedDB.
* For users with an account who have opted into sync:
  * Provide an option to delete only local data (leaving cloud data intact for restoration or use on other devices).
  * Provide an option to delete their entire account and all associated cloud data (GDPR right to be forgotten). This requires a backend API call.
* Clear confirmation dialogs must be presented before any data deletion operation.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: An anonymous user can, after confirmation, successfully delete all their local StrongLog data from IndexedDB. The app should then behave like a fresh install.
* AC2: An authenticated user can, after confirmation, successfully delete only their local StrongLog data. Cloud data remains. App behaves like fresh install but can re-sync.
* AC3: An authenticated user can, after confirmation, successfully initiate a request via the API Client Service to delete their account and all associated cloud data. The client should handle the response (e.g., log user out locally, clear local data).
* AC4: Clear, unambiguous confirmation dialogs are presented before any data deletion operation, explaining the consequences.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/settings/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` (or `DataManagementPage.tsx` - to add deletion buttons).
    * `src/features/settings/components/DeleteDataDialog.tsx`.
    * `src/services/data/userService.ts` (or `settingsService.ts` for local deletion logic).
    * `src/services/auth/authService.ts` (extend to include `deleteAccountAndCloudData` which uses `apiClient.ts`).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/services/data/db.ts` (for `db.delete()` and clearing tables).
    * `src/services/sync/apiClient.ts` (to call backend delete account endpoint).
    * `docs/api-reference.md` (needs a 'DELETE /account' or similar endpoint definition).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (`Button`, `AlertDialog`), Dexie.js, TypeScript.
  * Fetch API (in `apiClient.ts`).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js: `db.delete()` to delete the entire local database, or `db.table.clear()` for each table.
  * `apiClient.ts` makes an authenticated DELETE request to a backend endpoint like `/api/v1/account` or `/users/me`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * N/A for new structures, primarily involves deleting existing data.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Deletion operations are destructive; confirmations must be very clear.
  * Ensure proper logout and clearing of local auth tokens after successful cloud account deletion.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for error handling and security)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for data deletion options within the settings screen, including distinct buttons for "Delete Local Data" and (if authenticated and synced) "Delete Account & Cloud Data".
* [ ] Implement reusable `DeleteDataDialog.tsx` component for confirmations, clearly stating what will be deleted.
* [ ] Implement client-side logic in a service (e.g., `userService.ts`) for deleting all local Dexie.js data (e.g., by closing and deleting the database `Dexie.delete('StrongLogDB')` or clearing all tables).
* [ ] If user is authenticated, modify the "Delete Local Data" option to only clear local tables but not log out or affect cloud data status.
* [ ] Extend `apiClient.ts` (from Story 7.7) to include a method for making a DELETE request to the backend "delete account and all cloud data" endpoint (e.g., `DELETE /api/v1/account`). This endpoint needs to be defined in `docs/api-reference.md`.
* [ ] Implement logic in `authService.ts` (or similar) that, for an authenticated user:
  * Calls the `apiClient.ts` method for cloud account deletion.
  * Upon successful response from backend: logs the user out locally, clears any stored auth tokens, and then triggers deletion of all local data.
* [ ] (Backend Task Placeholder) Define and implement the authenticated backend API endpoint for deleting a user's account and all their associated cloud data.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `DeleteDataDialog.tsx` component.
  * Test service logic for local data deletion (mock Dexie calls).
  * Test `authService.ts` logic for initiating cloud account deletion (mock `apiClient.ts` calls).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest):**
  * Seed Dexie.js with data. Trigger local data deletion. Verify Dexie.js is empty.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Scenario 1 (Anonymous): Add some data. Go to settings -> Delete local data. Confirm. Verify app resets to a fresh state and data is gone from IndexedDB.
  * Scenario 2 (Authenticated, Local Delete Only): Create account, opt-in to sync, sync some data. Go to settings -> Delete local data. Confirm. Verify local data is gone but user is still logged in (or if logged out, can log back in and re-sync data from mock cloud).
  * Scenario 3 (Authenticated, Cloud Delete): Create account, opt-in to sync, sync some data. Go to settings -> Delete Account & Cloud Data. Confirm. (Requires mock backend to simulate successful deletion). Verify user is logged out, local data is cleared, and subsequent login fails.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Mocking backend responses for account deletion is crucial for E2E.)_
