# Story 8.3: Accessibility Review and Enhancements

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a development team, we want to review the application for accessibility and implement enhancements, so that StrongLog V1.0 is usable by people with a wider range of abilities.

**Context:** This story focuses on improving the accessibility of the application, aiming to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines where feasible. It involves auditing existing components and implementing necessary fixes.

## Detailed Requirements

* Conduct an accessibility review against target standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA where feasible for a PWA).
* Ensure adequate color contrast for text and UI elements.
* Verify keyboard navigability for all interactive components (buttons, inputs, links, custom controls).
* Add appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes for custom controls and dynamic content where necessary to provide semantic meaning.
* Ensure alternative text for meaningful images/icons (if any non-decorative images/icons are used).
* Test with screen reader tools (basic testing on major platforms).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: An accessibility audit (automated and manual checks) has been performed across all major V1.0 features and UI components.
* AC2: Color contrast ratios meet minimum WCAG 2.1 AA requirements (e.g., 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and graphical objects) for text and essential UI elements.
* AC3: All interactive elements are focusable and operable via keyboard in a logical order.
* AC4: Key custom components (e.g., complex `shadcn/ui` compositions if customized, custom interactive elements) have appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties.
* AC5: Basic screen reader testing (e.g., VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android, NVDA/JAWS on desktop if testing there) confirms core content and interactive elements are perceivable and operable.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Potentially any UI component file across `src/features/` and `src/components/`.
  * Global CSS files (`src/styles/global.css`) or Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.cjs`) if theme color adjustments are needed.
  * _(Hint: Accessibility improvements may touch many parts of the codebase.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS).
  * ARIA attributes.
  * Accessibility Testing Tools:
    * Browser Developer Tools (Accessibility Inspector).
    * Axe DevTools (browser extension or `axe-core` library).
    * Screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack, NVDA).
  * `shadcn/ui` (components are built with Radix UI primitives, which are accessibility-focused, but custom usage needs verification).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list and `docs/testing-strategy.md` for accessibility tools.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * N/A directly, focuses on HTML semantics and component properties.

* **Data Structures:**
  * N/A.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Use semantic HTML elements where possible.
  * Ensure `tabindex` is used correctly for managing focus.
  * Provide visually hidden labels for icon-only buttons if `aria-label` is not sufficient.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for general standards. Focus on W3C ARIA practices.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Use automated accessibility checking tools (e.g., Axe DevTools browser extension) to scan all major pages and components. Log and categorize findings.
* [ ] Manually review and test for keyboard-only navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable using Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys as appropriate. Check for logical focus order.
* [ ] Check color contrast ratios for text, icons, and important UI elements using browser dev tools or specialized contrast checkers. Adjust theme colors or component styles in Tailwind/CSS as needed.
* [ ] Review custom components and dynamic content areas; add necessary ARIA attributes (roles, states like `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, properties like `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) to enhance semantic meaning for assistive technologies.
* [ ] Ensure all meaningful images have descriptive `alt` text. Decorative images should have empty `alt=""`. If using SVG icons that are meaningful, ensure they have appropriate `title` elements or are accompanied by `aria-label` on their button/container.
* [ ] Perform basic screen reader testing on key user flows (e.g., logging a workout, creating a rule, navigating settings) using one or two common screen readers. Identify and fix issues related to content announcement, element roles, and operability.
* [ ] Implement fixes for identified accessibility issues.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * For components with specific ARIA attributes, unit tests can assert their presence and correct values based on component state/props.
  * Consider integrating `jest-axe` or a similar library with Vitest to run automated Axe checks on rendered components in unit tests.
* **Manual Testing:**
  * CRITICAL for this story. Re-run automated Axe scans after fixes.
  * Perform thorough keyboard navigation testing again.
  * Re-test with screen readers on key flows.
  * Verify color contrast fixes.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Playwright can integrate with `axe-core` to run accessibility scans as part of E2E tests. Add these checks to critical page E2E tests.
  * E2E tests inherently cover keyboard operability to some extent if actions are performed via keyboard commands.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`, particularly section 3.2 on Accessibility Testing.)_
