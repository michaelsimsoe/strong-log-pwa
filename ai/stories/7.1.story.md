# Story 7.1: StrongLifts Data Import - UI & File Handling

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a new user migrating from StrongLifts, I want an easy-to-use interface to upload my StrongLifts export file, so I can begin the data import process.

**Context:** This story initiates the StrongLifts data import feature (FRJ) by creating the user interface for file selection and basic client-side validation. This is the first step to allow users to bring their existing workout history into StrongLog.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a clear UI section for initiating the StrongLifts data import (e.g., in Settings or an onboarding flow).
* The UI must guide the user on how to obtain their export file from the StrongLifts app.
* Implement a file selector component allowing users to choose their StrongLifts export file (typically CSV) from their device storage.
* Basic validation of the selected file (e.g., file type should be `.csv`, file should not be empty) before starting the parsing process.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can access the StrongLifts data import function from the app settings or an initial setup flow.
* AC2: Clear instructions on obtaining the StrongLifts export file are displayed within the UI.
* AC3: User can successfully select and upload a CSV file using a standard HTML file input dialog.
* AC4: The system performs a basic client-side check for file type (expects CSV based on extension or MIME type if possible), non-empty content, and possibly a reasonable file size limit before proceeding with parsing logic (Story 7.2).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/data-management/pages/ImportDataPage.tsx` (or a dedicated `StrongLiftsImportPage.tsx`)
    * `src/features/data-management/components/ImportInstructions.tsx`
    * `src/features/data-management/components/FileInput.tsx` (reusable file input component)
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure, likely under a `data-management` feature or within `settings`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Button`, `Card` for instructions, custom styled file input or a library if `shadcn/ui` doesn't offer one directly)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * HTML File API (for file selection and basic properties).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Browser's File API (`<input type="file">`, `FileList`, `File` object).

* **Data Structures:**
  * `File` object from the browser.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Ensure file input is accessible.
  * Provide clear user feedback if basic file validation fails (e.g., "Please select a CSV file.").
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design the UI for the StrongLifts import initiation screen, including a section for instructions on how to get the export file from StrongLifts, and the file selection area.
* [ ] Implement a React component for file input that allows users to select a file from their local device. Ensure it filters for CSV files if possible via the `accept` attribute.
* [ ] Implement client-side validation logic upon file selection:
  * Check if a file was selected.
  * Check file extension (e.g., `.csv`).
  * Check if file is non-empty.
  * (Optional) Check for a reasonable maximum file size to prevent browser issues with huge files before actual parsing.
* [ ] Display appropriate error messages if these basic validations fail.
* [ ] On successful basic validation, prepare the `File` object to be passed to the parsing logic (Story 7.2).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the `FileInput.tsx` component: interactions, file selection (mocking `File` objects), validation messages.
  * Test the basic file validation logic (file type, empty check).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the `ImportDataPage.tsx` to ensure instructions are displayed and the file input component is correctly integrated.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Navigate to import page -> See instructions -> Click file selector -> Select a valid CSV file -> No immediate error.
  * User flow: Select an invalid file type (e.g., .txt, .png) -> Verify an appropriate error message is shown.
  * User flow: Attempt to proceed without selecting a file -> Verify an error message.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
