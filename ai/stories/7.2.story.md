# Story 7.2: StrongLifts Data Import - Parsing & Mapping Logic

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a system, when a StrongLifts export file is uploaded, I need to parse its content and accurately map the workout data to StrongLog's data structures, so it can be integrated into the user's history.

**Context:** This story handles the core logic of the StrongLifts import: parsing the CSV data and transforming it into StrongLog's native data models (`WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`, `ExerciseDefinition`), including validation using Zod. This follows Story 7.1 where the file is selected.

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement client-side logic to parse the StrongLifts CSV export file. Client-side CSV parsing will be implemented (e.g., using a lightweight library like PapaParse or robust custom parsing logic if the format is simple and consistent).
* Correctly identify and map fields such as `date`, `exercise name`, `weight`, `sets`, and `reps` from the StrongLifts format to StrongLog's internal data model.
* Handle variations in exercise naming:
  * Attempt to match imported exercise names to existing StrongLog default or custom exercises (created in Epic 1.4).
  * If no match is found, automatically create new custom exercises in StrongLog based on the names in the import file.
* Ensure correct interpretation and conversion of units (kg/lbs) from the StrongLifts data, potentially prompting the user for clarification if ambiguity exists or if their StrongLog default unit (from `UserSettings`) is different.
* The data structures resulting from parsing and mapping the StrongLifts export must be validated against **Zod schemas** (corresponding to StrongLog's internal data models like `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`, `ExerciseDefinition` from `docs/data-models.md`) before attempting to save them to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The system correctly parses valid StrongLifts CSV files using a client-side parser (e.g., PapaParse or equivalent custom logic).
* AC2: Workout dates, exercise names, weights, set counts, and rep counts are accurately extracted from each relevant row of the CSV.
* AC3: Exercise names from the import are correctly mapped to existing StrongLog `ExerciseDefinition`s (case-insensitive match) or new custom `ExerciseDefinition`s are created if no match is found.
* AC4: Weight units (kg/lbs) from the imported data are correctly interpreted and converted to the user's preferred StrongLog unit (from `UserSettings`) if necessary. User may be prompted if ambiguity arises.
* AC5: Parsed and transformed data (arrays of `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`, and new `ExerciseDefinition` objects) is validated against their respective Zod schemas before being passed to the saving stage (Story 7.3).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/data-management/services/strongLiftsImporter.ts` (or similar service for parsing and mapping logic).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Zod schemas for `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`, `ExerciseDefinition` from Epic 1).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/services/data/exerciseService.ts` (to check for existing exercises and create new ones).
    * `src/services/data/db.ts` (to access `exerciseDefinitions`, `userSettings`).
  * _(Hint: `docs/data-models.md` defines the target StrongLog structures.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * CSV Parsing Library (e.g., PapaParse - **Note:** Not in current `tech-stack.md`, agent will need to decide to add or use custom robust parsing logic). If a library is chosen, it should be added to `docs/tech-stack.md`. For now, assume a suitable solution will be implemented.
  * Zod: (for validating transformed data).
  * Dexie.js: (for querying existing exercises and user settings).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * CSV Parser API (if library used).
  * Dexie.js API to query `exerciseDefinitions` and `userSettings`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Input: Raw CSV string content or `File` object.
  * Intermediate: Parsed representation of CSV rows.
  * Output: Arrays of `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet`, and new `ExerciseDefinition` objects conforming to StrongLog's Zod schemas.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Robust error handling during parsing (e.g., malformed rows, unexpected data types).
  * Exercise name matching should be case-insensitive and handle minor variations if possible (e.g., "Squat" vs "Squats").
  * Unit conversion logic must be accurate.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Research and obtain sample StrongLifts CSV export files to finalize understanding of their typical structure and variations.
* [ ] Choose and integrate a client-side CSV parsing library (e.g., PapaParse, if decided) or implement robust custom CSV parsing logic tailored to the StrongLifts format.
* [ ] Implement logic in `strongLiftsImporter.ts` to iterate through parsed CSV rows and extract relevant fields (date, exercise name, weight, sets x reps string like "5x5", "3x8", "1x5+").
* [ ] Implement logic to parse set/rep schemes (e.g., "5x5", "1x5+") into individual `LoggedSet` objects. StrongLifts typically logs sets as successful or failed at target reps, so this might be simpler than parsing varied reps per set. Assume standard sets are imported.
* [ ] Develop exercise name matching logic:
  * Query existing `ExerciseDefinition`s from Dexie.js.
  * Implement case-insensitive matching.
  * If no match, prepare a new `ExerciseDefinition` object for creation.
* [ ] Implement unit handling:
  * Attempt to infer units from StrongLifts data if possible (often not explicitly stated in older exports, may default to user's app setting or need prompting).
  * Convert weights to the user's preferred unit in StrongLog (from `UserSettings`) if necessary.
* [ ] Implement transformation logic to map parsed data into arrays of `WorkoutLog`, `LoggedSet` (standard sets for V1.0 import simplicity), and new `ExerciseDefinition` objects.
* [ ] Ensure all generated StrongLog objects are validated against their respective Zod schemas defined in `src/types/data.types.ts` (from Epic 1). If validation fails for a record, it should be logged/reported (Story 7.3).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test CSV parsing logic with various sample StrongLifts CSV inputs (valid, malformed, different exercise names, kg/lbs if distinguishable).
  * Test data mapping functions for each field (date, exercise, weight, sets, reps).
  * Test exercise name matching and new exercise creation logic (mock Dexie calls).
  * Test unit conversion logic.
  * Test Zod validation of transformed data structures.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test the entire `strongLiftsImporter.ts` service: input a sample CSV string, mock Dexie.js calls for existing exercises/settings, and verify the output arrays of Zod-validated StrongLog objects.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * While full E2E save is Story 7.3, this story's logic is a precursor. E2E for 7.3 will implicitly test this. Focused E2E here could involve uploading a file and checking (if possible via dev tools or UI feedback in 7.3) the intermediate parsed/mapped data or error states before saving.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach. Use diverse sample StrongLifts files for testing.)_
