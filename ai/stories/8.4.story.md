# Story 8.4: Final End-to-End Testing & Bug Fixing

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a development team, we want to conduct thorough end-to-end testing of all StrongLog V1.0 features and user flows, including the PWA update process, and fix identified bugs, to ensure a stable and reliable application at launch.

**Context:** This story represents the final phase of testing before release. It involves comprehensive E2E testing covering all integrated features from Epics 1-7, performance checks, and dedicated bug fixing to ensure overall application quality and stability.

## Detailed Requirements

* Execute comprehensive E2E test scenarios covering all epics (Epic 1-7 functionality). This includes:
  * Anonymous usage and account creation/sync (Epic 1, 7).
  * Logging all standard and advanced set types (Epic 1, 2).
  * Defining and applying progression rules (Epic 3).
  * Creating, managing, and following programs with adaptive scheduling (Epic 4).
  * Setting and tracking goals (Epic 5).
  * Using the dashboard and all analytics views (Epic 6).
  * Data import (StrongLifts) and full V1.0 data export (Epic 7).
  * Offline functionality for all core features.
* Test on a range of representative mobile devices and browsers (iOS/Safari, Android/Chrome).
* Focus on data integrity (local Dexie.js data, and synced data if applicable), state management (especially with client-side engines FRX, FRY, FRZ interacting), and performance under typical V1.0 usage patterns.
* All critical and major bugs identified during this phase must be fixed before release.
* E2E test scenarios must explicitly cover the PWA update notification flow (from Story 8.2) and successful activation of the new application version.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: A comprehensive E2E test plan for V1.0, covering all features from Epics 1-7, has been executed using Playwright and manual testing where appropriate.
* AC2: All core user flows function as expected across supported devices/browsers (iOS/Safari, Android/Chrome).
* AC3: Offline functionality for all V1.0 core features (logging, viewing history/analytics on local data, rule/program/goal management with local data) is verified.
* AC4: Data integrity is maintained across all operations, including local storage and, if sync is enabled, consistency with the (mocked or dev) backend.
* AC5: No known critical or major bugs exist in the release candidate build.
* AC6: Performance meets the defined NFR targets (PWA load time, UI interaction latency, engine processing not blocking UI) under test conditions with representative data.
* AC7: E2E tests for the PWA update notification and successful activation of the new version pass consistently.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * `tests/e2e/` directory: This is where Playwright test scripts will be expanded or created.
  * Test plan documents (external to code, but referenced).
  * Bug tracking system (external).
  * _(Hint: This story is about executing tests and fixing code across the entire application based on `docs/testing-strategy.md`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Playwright: `~1.44.x` (for automated E2E tests).
  * Browser Developer Tools (for debugging, performance profiling, PWA checks).
  * Physical mobile devices or emulators/simulators for device-specific testing.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` and `docs/testing-strategy.md`.)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Playwright API for browser automation.
  * If testing sync, will interact with mock backend API.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Test data sets for various scenarios (e.g., new user, user with extensive history, user with multiple active programs/goals). `docs/testing-strategy.md` (Test Data Management).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * May need specific environment variables for E2E test runs (e.g., pointing to a test backend or specific user credentials for test accounts).

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Bug fixes should follow existing coding standards.
  * New E2E tests should be clear, maintainable, and cover critical paths.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`.)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Develop a detailed E2E test plan document covering all V1.0 user stories and acceptance criteria from Epics 1-7, including PWA update flow. This plan should specify scenarios, test data, and expected outcomes.
* [ ] Write new Playwright E2E test scripts based on the test plan, or update existing ones to ensure full coverage. Specifically, add Playwright tests for the PWA update notification UI and service worker update activation (from Story 8.2).
* [ ] Execute the E2E test plan (automated Playwright scripts and manual exploratory testing) on target devices/browsers (Android/Chrome, iOS/Safari).
* [ ] Perform targeted offline functionality testing for all core features.
* [ ] Conduct performance testing on key flows with representative data volumes, checking against NFRs (e.g., PWA load times, interaction latency, engine processing not blocking UI). Use browser dev tools for profiling.
* [ ] Log all bugs found during E2E testing into a bug tracking system.
* [ ] Prioritize and fix all identified critical and major bugs. Each bug fix should ideally include a regression test (unit, integration, or E2E).
* [ ] Perform regression testing after bug fixes to ensure no new issues were introduced.
* [ ] Maintain a list of known minor bugs or limitations for V1.0 if any are deferred.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** This story _is_ the testing. It validates the output of all previous stories at an E2E level.

* **Automated E2E Tests (Playwright):** Primary mechanism for executing the test plan.
* **Manual Exploratory Testing:** To catch issues not covered by automated scripts, especially around UX, complex interactions, and device-specific quirks.
* **Performance Profiling:** Using browser developer tools during E2E test execution of key scenarios.
* **Offline Testing:** Manually or using Playwright's network emulation to verify offline behavior.
* _(Hint: Follow the detailed E2E test plan developed in the first task. Refer to `docs/testing-strategy.md` for overall testing approaches for different features.)_
