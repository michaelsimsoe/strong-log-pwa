# Story 4.4: Program State Tracking & Next Workout Suggestion (in FRY Worker)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a system, for each active program, I need to track the user's current position in its workout sequence and use this, along with applied progression rules, to determine and suggest the specific exercises and target parameters for the next due workout, with core logic in a Web Worker.

**Context:** This is a core backend story for the FRY Engine. It involves the FRY worker accessing Dexie.js to read program state, definitions, and FRX-generated adjustments, then constructing the next specific workout plan. This is heavily guided by `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md` and `docs/fit_together.md`.

## Detailed Requirements

* This core logic (program state tracking, next workout identification, application of FRX outputs) will primarily reside within the **FRY Engine, running in a Shared Web Worker**.
* The FRY worker must have access to **Dexie.js** to read `ProgramDefinitions`, `ActiveProgramInstances`, and `AppliedProgressionActions/Suggestions` (from FRX, stored in `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`), and to update `ActiveProgramInstances`.
* For each active program instance, the system must store and update its current state in the `ActiveProgramInstance` entity in Dexie.js (e.g., `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram`, `lastCompletedWorkoutDate`).
* When a user queries "what's next?" for a program (e.g., application logic calls the FRY worker), the FRY worker identifies the next workout in the sequence and populates it with targets adjusted by FRX outputs (from `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`).
* The structure for `ActiveProgramInstance` data, including how it stores `progressionAdjustments` and `carriedOverExercises` (for Story 4.6), must be validated by a **Zod schema** when read or written by the FRY engine.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The FRY worker correctly tracks the last completed workout for each active program instance by reading and updating its `ActiveProgramInstance` Dexie.js record.
* AC2: The FRY worker correctly identifies the next workout in the `ProgramDefinition` sequence for an active program based on `ActiveProgramInstance.currentWorkoutOrderInProgram`.
* AC3: When suggesting the next workout, its exercises and their target parameters are correctly adjusted by FRX outputs (read from `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`) with this logic performed in the worker.
* AC4: This "next workout plan" (a `GeneratedWorkoutPlan` object as defined in `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md`) is available from the FRY worker for the user to view via the UI (UI display handled in other stories like dashboard/program view).
* AC5: Interactions with `ActiveProgramInstance` data (reads/writes by FRY worker) are validated using its Zod schema.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/services/engines/fry.worker.ts` (Implement `getNextWorkoutPlan` and state update logic).
    * `src/services/engines/fry/fryLogic.ts` (Implement `generateNextWorkoutContent`, `updateProgramStateOnCompletion`).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Define `GeneratedWorkoutPlan`, ensure `ActiveProgramInstance` Zod schema).
  * Files to Modify (for prerequisites):
    * `vite.config.ts` (for Shared Web Worker bundling, Comlink compatibility).
    * `src/services/engines/comlink.setup.ts` (for FRY worker).
    * `src/services/data/db.ts` (ensure accessible by worker).
  * _(Hint: `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md` provides detailed structure and conceptual code for `fry.worker.ts` and `fryLogic.ts`. `docs/fit_together.md` details FRX/FRY interaction through `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Shared Web Workers, Comlink, Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Comlink API for main thread to call `getNextWorkoutPlan` on FRY worker.
  * Dexie.js API for all DB interactions within the worker.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ActiveProgramInstance` (read and updated).
  * `ProgramDefinition` (read).
  * `WorkoutTemplate` and `WorkoutTemplateExerciseInstance` (read).
  * `GeneratedWorkoutPlan` (output structure).
  * Zod schema for `ActiveProgramInstance`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Logic for applying `progressionAdjustments` must be robust.
  * State updates to `ActiveProgramInstance` (e.g., advancing `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram`, handling cycle completion) must be accurate.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` and `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md`)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **(Engine Infrastructure - Prerequisite TS-11, TS-12):** Ensure Vite is configured for the FRY Shared Web Worker (`fry.worker.ts`), Comlink setup is in place for FRY, and Dexie.js (`db`) is accessible within `fry.worker.ts`.
* [ ] Define the Zod schema for the `ActiveProgramInstance` data model, including validation for `progressionAdjustments` and `carriedOverExercises` structures.
* [ ] Implement `generateNextWorkoutContent` function in `src/services/engines/fry/fryLogic.ts` as detailed in `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md`. This includes:
  * Fetching the correct `ProgramWorkoutDefinitionEntry`.
  * Resolving exercises from `WorkoutTemplate` or `adHocExercises`.
  * Applying `progressionAdjustments` from the `ActiveProgramInstance` to the target parameters of these exercises.
  * (Deferring `carriedOverExercises` application to Story 4.6 task)
* [ ] Implement the `getNextWorkoutPlan` method in `fry.worker.ts` which calls `generateNextWorkoutContent` and returns the `GeneratedWorkoutPlan`.
* [ ] Implement `updateProgramStateOnCompletion` function in `fryLogic.ts` (called by `logProgramWorkoutCompletion` in Story 4.6) to update `ActiveProgramInstance` fields like `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram`, `lastCompletedWorkoutDate`, and `completedWorkoutHistory`.
* [ ] Ensure Zod validation is used when the FRY worker reads or writes `ActiveProgramInstance` data.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRY testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test `generateNextWorkoutContent` logic with various `ActiveProgramInstance` states (different `progressionAdjustments`) and `ProgramDefinition` structures. Mock Dexie calls.
  * Test `updateProgramStateOnCompletion` logic for correct state transitions.
  * Test Zod schema for `ActiveProgramInstance`.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest, worker context):**
  * Test the FRY worker's `getNextWorkoutPlan` Comlink method: Provide an `activeProgramInstanceId`, ensure worker correctly fetches data from (mocked or simple real) Dexie.js, applies mocked FRX adjustments, and returns the expected `GeneratedWorkoutPlan`.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * After FRX has run (from Epic 3 tests), and an `ActiveProgramInstance` has `progressionAdjustments`:
    * Invoke (via UI that calls FRY) the generation of the next workout plan.
    * Verify the UI displays this plan with the correct FRX-induced adjustments. (Actual UI display for this is part of other stories e.g. Dashboard).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRY testplan.md` for details)_
