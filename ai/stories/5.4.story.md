# Story 5.4: Goal Visualization (Dashboard & Dedicated Goals Section)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a clear visual representation of my active goals and my progress towards them, both on my main dashboard and in a dedicated goals section, so I can stay motivated and informed.

**Context:** This story focuses on the UI aspects of displaying goal progress, making it easily accessible and understandable for the user. It relies on the progress calculation logic from Story 5.3.

## Detailed Requirements

* **Dashboard Snapshot (FR6.1.2):** Display 1-2 key active goals with a visual progress indicator (e.g., progress bar, percentage complete).
* **Dedicated Goals Section:**
  * List all active goals, showing name, target, current progress (e.g., "Squat 1RM: 120kg / 140kg"), and target date if set.
  * For "Specific Lift Target" goals, potentially show a mini-chart of progress towards that specific lift's target.
  * For "Program Completion" goals, show percentage complete or workouts remaining.
* Visuals should be clear, concise, and motivating.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: At least one active goal with its progress (e.g., fetched from `UserGoal.currentValue`) is visible on the main dashboard, including a visual indicator like a progress bar.
* AC2: A dedicated "Goals" section (from Story 5.2 list view, enhanced here) lists all active goals with their details and current progress status, fetched reactively.
* AC3: Visual indicators (e.g., progress bars, simple text like "X% complete") clearly represent progress towards goals.
* AC4: Information presented is accurate based on current progress calculations (from Story 5.3, reflected in `UserGoal` records).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/dashboard/components/GoalSnapshot.tsx` (for FR6.1.2 integration)
    * `src/features/goals/pages/GoalListPage.tsx` (enhance from Story 5.2 to include better progress display).
    * `src/features/goals/components/GoalListItem.tsx` (enhance to show progress).
    * `src/features/goals/components/ProgressBar.tsx` (or use a `shadcn/ui` equivalent if available/suitable).
    * Potentially `src/features/goals/components/GoalProgressChart.tsx` (simple mini-chart for lift targets if implemented).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. This story enhances UI built in 5.2 and provides components for Epic 6.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (for layout, text, potentially progress bars or charts if available/simple).
  * `dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`) to reactively fetch `UserGoal` data with updated progress.
  * Recharts (if mini-charts are implemented, though not a hard requirement for this story's core progress display).
  * TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch `UserGoal` records from Dexie.js.
  * Potentially Recharts API if implementing mini-charts.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserGoal` (reading `name`, `type`, target fields, `currentValue`, `status`).
  * Data prepared for progress bars (e.g., current value, target value, percentage).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Visualizations should be clear and accessible (good contrast, readable text).
  * Dashboard snapshot should be concise and not take up too much space.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the goal snapshot to be displayed on the main dashboard (e.g., for 1-2 goals, showing name, progress bar, current/target values).
* [ ] Implement the `GoalSnapshot.tsx` component, fetching data for key active goals using `useLiveQuery` and rendering their progress.
* [ ] Enhance the `GoalListPage.tsx` and `GoalListItem.tsx` (from Story 5.2) to clearly display current progress for each active goal (e.g., "120kg / 140kg" or "60% complete").
* [ ] Implement or integrate a progress bar component (e.g., custom or `shadcn/ui` if available) for use in both dashboard snapshot and goals list.
* [ ] (Optional, if time permits for V1.0 and simple enough) Design and implement a mini-chart (e.g., using Recharts) within the goal detail view for "Specific Lift Target" goals to show trend of `currentValue` towards target.
* [ ] Ensure all displayed progress information is sourced reactively from the `UserGoal` records in Dexie.js, which are updated by Story 5.3's logic.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRZ testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `GoalSnapshot.tsx` and `GoalListItem.tsx` (enhanced version) with various mocked `UserGoal` data (different progress levels, goal types) to ensure correct rendering of progress.
  * Test `ProgressBar.tsx` component if custom.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * With a seeded Dexie.js state (UserGoals with `currentValue` populated by mocked Story 5.3 logic), test that `GoalListPage.tsx` and `GoalSnapshot.tsx` correctly fetch and display this progress data using `useLiveQuery`.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * After creating goals (Story 5.1) and logging data that updates progress (Story 5.3 mechanisms):
    * Verify the dashboard snapshot shows correct progress for a key goal.
    * Navigate to the dedicated goals section and verify all active goals display accurate progress.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRZ testplan.md` for details)_
