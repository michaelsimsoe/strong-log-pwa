# Story 2.4: Defining and Logging Pyramid Sets

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to define and log a "Pyramid Set" for an exercise, specifying the sequence of ascending/descending weights and reps for each sub-set within the pyramid, so I can accurately record this structured training approach.

**Context:** This story introduces logging for Pyramid Sets, a complex set structure involving multiple sub-sets with varying weights/reps. It requires a way to define this structure and log each part, using the Integrated Timer for rest periods.

## Detailed Requirements

* Allow an exercise block to be designated as a "Pyramid Set".
* Provide an interface for the user to define the structure of the pyramid: number of sub-sets, target `weight` and `reps` for each.
* During workout logging, the user should see each defined sub-set of the pyramid and be able to log their actual performance against the planned targets for each. Rest periods between these sub-sets can be managed using the **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)**.
* The system must store the pyramid structure and the performance for each sub-set. The `groupKey` and `level` fields in the `LoggedSet` model (specifically for `PyramidSet` type or standard sets part of a pyramid) will be used to link these sub-sets.
* The data structure for each sub-set (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`, likely as individual `LoggedSet` entries of type 'pyramid' or 'standard' linked by a `groupKey`) must be validated using its corresponding **Zod schema** before being saved to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select "Pyramid Set" as a type for an exercise block when creating a template or during an active workout.
* AC2: User can define multiple sub-sets (each with planned weight and reps) within the pyramid structure.
* AC3: During logging, each sub-set of the pyramid is presented sequentially for the user to confirm/log actual weight and reps.
* AC4: The saved workout log accurately reflects the entire pyramid structure and the performance for each sub-set, with sub-sets correctly linked (using `groupKey` and `level`) and data passing Zod validation upon saving.
* AC5: The **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** can be used for timing rest between sub-sets of the pyramid.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx` (or a new `PyramidSetLogger.tsx`).
    * `src/features/logging/components/PyramidSubSetInput.tsx`.
    * `src/features/logging/hooks/useActiveWorkout.ts`.
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts`.
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `PyramidSet` interface and Zod schema from `docs/data-models.md`).
    * `src/features/logging/components/IntegratedWorkoutTimer.tsx` (from Story 2.6).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` & `docs/data-models.md` for `LoggedSet` union, `PyramidSet` type, and use of `groupKey` and `level`)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript.
  * Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving multiple `LoggedSet` records (each sub-set of the pyramid) with a common `groupKey`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `LoggedSet` union type, specifically the `PyramidSet` interface, or multiple `StandardSet` instances linked by `groupKey`. `docs/data-models.md` defines `PyramidSet` as:

        ```typescript
        export interface PyramidSet extends BaseSet {
          setType: 'pyramid';
          groupKey?: string; // UUID to link parts of a pyramid or drop set
          level?: number; // e.g., 1st part of pyramid
          targetWeightKg?: number;
          targetReps?: number;
          loggedWeightKg: number;
          loggedReps: number;
        }
        ```

      Each sub-set will be an instance of this `PyramidSet` type (or similar), sharing a `groupKey`.
  * Corresponding Zod schema for `PyramidSet` (or the chosen sub-set structure).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * UI must allow defining multiple sub-sets and logging them sequentially.
  * Generation and usage of `groupKey` to link sub-sets is critical. `level` indicates order.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for defining a pyramid structure (number of sub-sets, target weight/reps for each) within the workout logging flow or template creation.
* [ ] Design UI for sequentially logging each defined sub-set of the pyramid, allowing confirmation/modification of actual weight/reps.
* [ ] Implement logic to generate a unique `groupKey` for each pyramid block and assign sequential `level` numbers to its sub-sets.
* [ ] Ensure `PyramidSet` interface and Zod schema are correctly defined/used as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Modify `workoutService.ts` to save multiple `LoggedSet` records (typed as `PyramidSet` or similar) for each sub-set, ensuring they share the same `groupKey` and have correct `level` values. Apply Zod validation to each sub-set.
* [ ] Integrate the **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** for managing rest periods between sub-sets.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. This story depends on Story 2.6 (Timer).

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for defining pyramid structure and logging sub-sets.
  * Test Zod schema for `PyramidSet` (or chosen sub-set structure).
  * Test `workoutService.ts` logic for saving pyramid sets (multiple linked records).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test defining a pyramid, logging all its sub-sets, and verifying correct storage in Dexie.js with linked `groupKey`.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Start workout, add exercise, define a pyramid structure (e.g., 3 sub-sets), log actuals for each, use timer for rests, finish workout. Verify data in history (when Epic 6.4 is done).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
