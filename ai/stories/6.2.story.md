# Story 6.2: Primary Dashboard - Goal Snapshot & Recent Achievements Implementation

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user on the dashboard, I want to see a snapshot of my key goals and recent achievements, so I can stay motivated and track high-level progress at a glance.

**Context:** This story adds motivational and informational sections to the dashboard, surfacing progress on goals (from Epic 5) and recent training milestones (from workout logs and FRX outputs).

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement the "Goal Snapshot Section" on the primary dashboard.
* Display 1-2 user-selected or key active goals (e.g., closest to completion or most recently updated) with a visual progress indicator (e.g., progress bar) and link to the full goals section (Epic 5.4).
* Implement the "Recent Achievements/Updates Section" (concise feed or list).
* Display recent Personal Records (PRs from `LoggedSet` data), significant progression milestones (from `AppliedProgressionLog` data from FRX), or newly achieved goals (`UserGoal` status update).
* Data displayed in this view/component will primarily be fetched reactively from Dexie.js using **`dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`)**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The Goal Snapshot section correctly displays data for 1-2 key active goals, including visual progress, fetched reactively using `useLiveQuery` from `UserGoal` records.
* AC2: Tapping the Goal Snapshot navigates to the full Goals section (implemented in Epic 5).
* AC3: The Recent Achievements section displays a list of recent, relevant events (e.g., new PRs on logged sets, "weight increased" from `AppliedProgressionLog`, "goal achieved" from `UserGoal`), fetched reactively.
* AC4: Data displayed in both sections is accurate and reflects the most up-to-date user progress and achievements from Dexie.js.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/dashboard/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` (to include these new sections).
    * `src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardGoalSnapshot.tsx` (distinct from `GoalSnapshot.tsx` in Epic 5.4 if dashboard version is different, or reuse).
    * `src/features/dashboard/components/RecentAchievements.tsx`
    * `src/features/dashboard/components/AchievementItem.tsx`
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (`UserGoal`, `LoggedSet`, `AppliedProgressionLogEntry`).
    * `src/services/data/goalService.ts`, `workoutService.ts`, `ruleService.ts` (for understanding how data is structured for querying).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. Relies on data populated by Epics 3 and 5.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Card`, list components, `ProgressBar`), Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`, TypeScript.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `useLiveQuery` to fetch:
    * `UserGoal` records (filtered for active, sorted by relevance for snapshot).
    * `LoggedSet` records (to identify PRs - requires logic to define what constitutes a PR for a given exercise/rep range).
    * `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` records (filtered for recent significant milestones).
    * `UserGoal` records (filtered for recently achieved).

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserGoal` (for snapshot and achieved goals).
  * `LoggedSet` (for PR detection).
  * `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` (for progression milestones).
  * Combined structure for "Recent Achievement" items if merging different event types into one feed.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Logic for determining "key" goals for the snapshot needs definition (e.g., nearest target date, most recently updated, user-pinned).
  * PR detection logic: compare new `LoggedSet` to previous `LoggedSet`s for the same exercise and rep count.
  * Combine diverse events into a single "Recent Achievements" feed with clear descriptions.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Develop UI for the "Goal Snapshot" section, including progress bars and navigation link.
* [ ] Implement logic using `useLiveQuery` to fetch and select 1-2 key active `UserGoal`s and their progress (from `UserGoal.currentValue` updated by FRZ logic in Epic 5) for the snapshot.
* [ ] Develop UI for the "Recent Achievements/Updates" section as a list or feed.
* [ ] Implement logic using `useLiveQuery` to fetch recent relevant data:
  * Potential PRs from `LoggedSet` data (e.g., highest weight for X reps for an exercise).
  * Significant progression milestones from `AppliedProgressionLog` (e.g., "Weight Increased for Squat").
  * Newly achieved `UserGoal`s (status changed to 'achieved').
* [ ] Format and merge these different data types into a unified list of "Recent Achievements" with appropriate descriptions and timestamps.
* [ ] Ensure navigation from Goal Snapshot to the full Goals section (Epic 5.4) works.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `DashboardGoalSnapshot.tsx` and `RecentAchievements.tsx` components with various mocked data inputs.
  * Test helper functions for PR detection and formatting achievement messages.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test components with `useLiveQuery` fetching data from a seeded Dexie.js state to ensure reactive updates and correct data display.
  * Seed Dexie with goals, workout logs (some PRs), and progression logs. Verify the dashboard sections populate correctly.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * After setting goals (Epic 5), logging workouts (Epic 1, 2), and having FRX apply progressions (Epic 3):
    * Verify Goal Snapshot shows relevant goal progress.
    * Verify Recent Achievements shows PRs, progression applications, and achieved goals accurately.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
