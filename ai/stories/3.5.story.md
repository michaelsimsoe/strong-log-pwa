# Story 3.5: Application of Rules to Workout Planning (in Web Worker)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a system, when a user plans or starts their next workout session for an exercise or program where progression rules were triggered, I need to automatically apply the defined actions (processed within the Web Worker) to adjust the target weights, reps, or sets for that upcoming session.

**Context:** This story follows Story 3.4. Once rules are evaluated and triggered actions are identified by the FRX worker, this story implements the logic within the same worker to apply these actions by modifying future planned workout data in Dexie.js or storing suggestions. This is a key part of closing the automation loop and is guided by `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md` and `docs/fit_together.md`.

## Detailed Requirements

* Based on the "triggered" rules from Story 3.4, the system applies the defined actions within the FRX worker.
* If multiple rules are triggered for the same exercise, a clear precedence or conflict resolution strategy must be defined and implemented in the worker (for V1.0, this might be "first rule matched" or user-defined priority if simple, otherwise flag for user, as per `FRX Implementation Plan.md`).
* The system updates the _planned parameters_ for the next relevant workout session by modifying data in Dexie.js (e.g., in an active program instance's `progressionAdjustments` field, or for the next time a template is used if rules are global/exercise-specific).
* This adjustment data is written to Dexie.js by the worker, so the main thread (e.g., FRY engine or UI) can reactively pick up these changes.
* For actions that are 'suggestions with option to apply' (Suggest Deload), this story involves the worker storing the _suggestion_ and its parameters in Dexie.js, associated with the planned workout. The actual programmatic application of the suggestion occurs after user confirmation (handled in Story 3.6 UI on the main thread).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When generating the next workout plan (by FRY, consuming data updated by FRX worker), actions from triggered rules (e.g., "increase weight by 2.5kg") are correctly reflected in the relevant exercises/sets by reading the `progressionAdjustments` in `ActiveProgramInstance` or similar storage.
* AC2: If an action is to "increase/decrease reps," the target reps for the relevant sets in the next workout plan reflect this update.
* AC3: If an action is to "hold parameters," the targets for the next workout plan remain the same as the last successfully completed one for that exercise.
* AC4: "Suggest Deload" actions from FRX result in a storable suggestion record in Dexie.js (e.g., within `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` or a dedicated log), which the UI can then present.
* AC5: The updated planned parameters or suggestions are persisted to Dexie.js by the FRX worker, and an `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` is created for each applied action or suggestion.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/services/engines/frx.worker.ts` (Extend `evaluateAndApplyProgressions` or call new functions).
    * `src/services/engines/frx/frxLogic.ts` (Implement `resolveConflicts` and `applyActions` as per `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`).
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Ensure `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` structure is suitable, `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` schema).
  * _(Hint: `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md` section 4 provides the structure for `resolveConflicts` and `applyActions`. `docs/fit_together.md` explains how FRX updates `ActiveProgramInstance` for FRY consumption.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Shared Web Workers, Comlink, `json-rules-engine`, Dexie.js, TypeScript (as in Story 3.4).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for reading `ActiveProgramInstance`, `ProgramDefinition`, and writing updates to `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` and `AppliedProgressionLog`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `TriggeredAction`, `ResolvedAction`, `AppliedProgressionResult` (as per `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`).
  * `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments`: A record/map to store adjustments like ` { 'exerciseId.targetWeightKg': newWeight, 'exerciseId.suggestion': 'Deload -10%' } `.
  * `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` (as per `docs/data-models.md`).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Conflict resolution logic must be clearly implemented and testable.
  * Updates to Dexie.js must be atomic where necessary (e.g., updating `ActiveProgramInstance` and creating `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` together). Dexie transactions can be used.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` and `docs/FRX Implementation Plan.md`)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Implement the `resolveConflicts` function in `src/services/engines/frx/frxLogic.ts` based on the V1.0 strategy (e.g., first rule applies for direct modifications, collect all unique suggestions).
* [ ] Implement the `applyActions` function in `src/services/engines/frx/frxLogic.ts`. This function will:
  * For direct parameter modifications, update the `progressionAdjustments` field in the relevant `ActiveProgramInstance` in Dexie.js (or other agreed-upon storage for future plan parameters).
  * For "Suggest Deload" actions, store the suggestion details in `progressionAdjustments` or a dedicated structure in Dexie.js.
  * For every applied action or stored suggestion, create and save an `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` to Dexie.js.
* [ ] Integrate `resolveConflicts` and `applyActions` into the main `evaluateAndApplyProgressions` method in `frx.worker.ts`.
* [ ] Ensure the structure for `ActiveProgramInstance.progressionAdjustments` in `docs/data-models.md` can accommodate both direct changes (e.g., new target weight) and suggestions (e.g., deload text).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRX testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test `resolveConflicts` function with various sets of triggered actions to ensure correct conflict resolution.
  * Test `applyActions` function:
    * For each action type (increase/decrease weight/reps, hold, suggest deload), verify it correctly prepares data for Dexie.js updates (mock Dexie calls).
    * Verify correct creation of `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` objects.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest, potentially with Dexie.js in-memory/mocked for worker context):**
  * Test the end-to-end flow within the worker: given a `workoutLogId`, verify that rules are evaluated (mocking this part if needed from 3.4 tests), conflicts resolved, and Dexie.js is updated correctly with `progressionAdjustments` and `AppliedProgressionLogEntry` records.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * These tests are crucial for verifying this story's outcomes by checking the _next_ workout plan.
  * Scenario: Define a rule -> Log a workout that triggers it -> Navigate to view/start the _next_ workout -> Verify the target parameters reflect the rule's action. -> Check progression history.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRX testplan.md` for details)_
