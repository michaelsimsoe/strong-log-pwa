# Story 7.4: Comprehensive V1.0 Data Export - Initiation & Format Selection

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to initiate an export of all my StrongLog V1.0 data (including workouts, exercises, rules, programs, goals, settings) and choose my preferred export format (CSV/JSON), so I have a complete backup and full ownership of my data.

**Context:** This story begins the implementation of the comprehensive data export feature, focusing on the user interface for initiating the export and selecting the desired file format.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a clear option in the app settings to "Export All Data".
* Allow the user to select the desired export format: CSV or JSON.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can find and activate the "Export All Data" function within the app settings.
* AC2: User is presented with clear options to choose the export format (CSV or JSON).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/data-management/pages/ExportDataPage.tsx` (or integrate into existing settings page like `src/features/settings/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` from Epic 8).
    * `src/features/data-management/components/ExportFormatSelector.tsx`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  * `shadcn/ui`: (e.g., `Button`, `RadioGroup` or `Select` for format selection)
  * TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * N/A for this story (UI only).

* **Data Structures:**
  * Local component state to hold the selected export format.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * UI should be straightforward and clearly explain what data will be exported.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design the UI for initiating data export, likely as a section within the app's settings page.
* [ ] Implement UI elements allowing the user to choose between CSV and JSON export formats (e.g., radio buttons or a select dropdown).
* [ ] Add a button to trigger the export process (which will invoke the logic from Story 7.5).
* [ ] Ensure the selected format is passed to the export processing logic.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the `ExportFormatSelector.tsx` component for interaction and state changes.
  * Test the page/section containing the export option for correct rendering of controls.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test that selecting a format and clicking "Export" correctly calls the (mocked) export initiation function with the chosen format.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Navigate to settings -> Find "Export All Data" -> Select CSV format -> Click Export. (Actual file generation is Story 7.5).
  * User flow: Select JSON format -> Click Export.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
