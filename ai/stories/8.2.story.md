# Story 8.2: Comprehensive UI/UX Review and Polish

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a development team, we want to conduct a full UI/UX review and apply polish across all V1.0 features, ensuring consistency, clarity, responsiveness, a user-friendly PWA update flow, and an excellent overall user experience before release.

**Context:** This is a crucial "quality gate" story. It involves a holistic review of the entire application's UI and UX, addressing inconsistencies, improving usability, and implementing the PWA update notification mechanism (TS-7).

## Detailed Requirements

* Review all user interfaces developed in Epics 1-7 for visual consistency (typography, spacing, colors, button styles, iconography based on `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS theme).
* Ensure all interactive elements (`Button`, `Input`, `Select`, custom components) have clear feedback states (hover, focus, active, disabled).
* Verify intuitive navigation flows and clear information hierarchy across the application.
* Check for consistent terminology and messaging (labels, instructions, error messages, success notifications) throughout the app.
* Optimize layouts for various mobile screen sizes and orientations (responsive design).
* Address any awkward workflows, confusing labels, or visual glitches identified during development or internal testing.
* Ensure loading states are handled gracefully for any data-intensive views or asynchronous operations (e.g., skeleton loaders, spinners).
* **(PWA Update Flow - TS-7):** A clear and user-friendly UI mechanism must be implemented to inform users when a new version of the PWA is available (due to a service worker update from `vite-plugin-pwa`) and provide them with an option to refresh and activate the new version.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: A comprehensive UI/UX audit has been performed across all V1.0 features (Epics 1-7).
* AC2: Identified UI inconsistencies in typography, spacing, color usage, and component styling (based on `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind theme) have been rectified.
* AC3: Navigation throughout the app is intuitive, predictable, and uses consistent patterns.
* AC4: All interactive elements provide appropriate visual feedback (hover, focus, active, disabled states).
* AC5: The app presents a polished and professional appearance on target mobile devices (iOS/Android) and common browser sizes.
* AC6: Known usability pain points and visual glitches identified during development or prior testing have been addressed.
* AC7: A PWA update notification UI (e.g., a non-intrusive toast or banner) is implemented and functions correctly when `vite-plugin-pwa` detects a new service worker, prompting users to refresh to get the new version.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Potentially any UI component file across `src/features/` and `src/components/`.
  * Global CSS files (`src/styles/global.css`).
  * `tailwind.config.cjs`.
  * Files for PWA Update UI:
    * `src/components/PwaUpdatePrompt.tsx` (or similar).
    * `src/App.tsx` or main layout component to integrate the prompt.
    * Service worker registration logic (managed by `vite-plugin-pwa`, but may need to hook into its events).
  * _(Hint: This story has a broad scope, touching many parts of the UI. `docs/architecture.md` mentions `vite-plugin-pwa` for service worker management.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
  * `vite-plugin-pwa` (for detecting service worker updates and providing hooks/events).
  * Browser DevTools (for inspecting styles, responsiveness, PWA features).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `vite-plugin-pwa` provides mechanisms to detect when a new service worker is ready (e.g., via events or a callback in its configuration). The UI needs to react to this.
  * To activate the new service worker and refresh, typically involves calling `workbox.messageSkipWaiting()` and then `window.location.reload()`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * N/A directly, focuses on UI presentation and interaction.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Consistency is key. Refer to any style guides or `shadcn/ui` best practices.
  * PWA update prompt should be user-friendly and not overly disruptive.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Create a UI/UX polish checklist covering consistency, feedback, navigation, terminology, responsiveness, loading states.
* [ ] Systematically review all major user flows and UI screens against the checklist.
* [ ] Log all identified UI/UX issues (e.g., in a bug tracker or shared document).
* [ ] Prioritize and implement fixes for identified UI/UX issues (CSS changes, layout adjustments, component refinements).
* [ ] **(TS-7) PWA Update Flow:**
  * Research `vite-plugin-pwa`'s mechanism for handling service worker updates and prompting users (e.g., `registerType: 'prompt'` and associated events/callbacks).
  * Design a non-intrusive UI element (e.g., a toast, banner) to inform the user "A new version is available. Refresh to update?".
  * Implement `PwaUpdatePrompt.tsx` component to display this message and an "Update" button.
  * Integrate this component into `App.tsx` or the main layout, making it visible when `vite-plugin-pwa` signals a new SW is waiting.
  * The "Update" button should trigger the service worker's `skipWaiting()` message and then reload the page.
* [ ] Test the PWA update flow locally by simulating a new build with changes.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `PwaUpdatePrompt.tsx` for rendering and button interaction (mocking SW update events/actions).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * N/A typically for broad UI polish, but specific refactored components might have integration tests.
* **Manual Testing:**
  * CRITICAL for this story. Perform thorough visual reviews across all screens and devices.
  * Test all interactive elements for feedback states.
  * Test all navigation flows.
  * Test responsiveness across different viewport sizes.
  * Manually trigger PWA update locally (e.g., make a small visible change, rebuild, serve, then revisit on a client that had old version cached) to test the update prompt and refresh mechanism.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Existing E2E tests will help verify that polish changes haven't broken functionality.
  * Add a specific E2E test for the PWA update prompt:
    * Load app, ensure SW is active.
    * Simulate a new SW becoming available (this might require advanced Playwright service worker interception or a specific test setup).
    * Verify the update prompt UI appears.
    * Click the update button, verify the page reloads, and potentially verify the new content/version is active.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach. Manual review and PWA update E2E test are key.)_
