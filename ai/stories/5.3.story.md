# Story 5.3: Goal Progress Calculation & Tracking Logic (Potentially in FRZ Worker)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a system, I need to calculate and update the user's current progress towards their active goals based on their logged workout data and, where applicable, their e1RM or other performance metrics, ensuring UI responsiveness.

**Context:** This story implements the core logic of the FRZ engine: calculating progress towards different types of goals. It involves data retrieval from Dexie.js, calculations (like e1RM), and potentially using a web worker if performance becomes an issue. This is heavily guided by `docs/FRZ Implementation Plan.md`.

## Detailed Requirements

* For **Specific Lift Target** goals:
  * Continuously (or on demand) compare the user's current best logged lift (or e1RM) for the target exercise and rep range against the goal target.
  * e1RM will be calculated using the **Epley formula** ($1RM = Weight \times (1 + Reps / 30)$) based on relevant logged sets.
* For **Program Completion** goals:
  * Track the number of completed workouts / percentage completion of the selected program instance.
* For **Bodyweight Target** goals:
  * Compare against the latest user-entered bodyweight value.
* This logic should run client-side, using data from IndexedDB.
* If progress calculation becomes computationally intensive, this logic should be executed within the **FRZ Engine, potentially running in a Shared Web Worker**. Simpler progress checks might be performed in main thread application logic. (`FRZ Implementation Plan.md` suggests main thread services for V1.0 initially).
* The FRZ worker (if used) must have access to **Dexie.js**.
* Progress should be stored (e.g., as `currentValue` in `UserGoal` entity) or recalculable for display.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: Progress for "Specific Lift Target" goals is correctly calculated based on relevant logged lifts or e1RM using the Epley formula.
* AC2: Progress for "Program Completion" goals is correctly calculated based on logged program workouts relative to the total in the `ProgramDefinition`.
* AC3: Progress for "Bodyweight Target" goals is based on the latest `UserBodyweightLog` entry.
* AC4: Progress calculations are updated when new relevant data (workout log, bodyweight entry, program workout logged) is saved, without blocking the UI.
* AC5: If a worker is used for FRZ calculations (deferred based on `FRZ Implementation Plan.md` for V1.0, but design for it), it correctly accesses Dexie.js and communicates results. (For V1.0, this AC means the main thread service performs correctly).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/services/engines/frz/frzService.ts` (Implement `calculateAllActiveGoalProgress`, `getGoalProgressDisplay`, etc.)
    * `src/services/engines/frz/frzCalculations.ts` (Implement `calculateEpleyE1RM`, `determineRelevantSetsForE1RM`).
    * `src/services/engines/frz/frzProgramGoalLogic.ts` (Implement `getProgramCompletionPercentage`).
    * `src/services/engines/frz/frzBodyweightGoalLogic.ts` (Implement `getBodyweightGoalProgress`).
  * Files for Worker (if decided for V1.0, otherwise deferred based on `FRZ Implementation Plan.md`):
    * `src/services/engines/frz.worker.ts`
    * `src/services/engines/comlink.setup.ts` (extend for FRZ worker).
  * _(Hint: `docs/FRZ Implementation Plan.md` details the service structure and specific calculation functions. `docs/Goal Setting & Tracking Engine (FRZ).md` outlines the e1RM formula.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * TypeScript, Dexie.js.
  * Potentially Shared Web Workers and Comlink if offloading calculations. (For V1.0, `FRZ Implementation Plan.md` leans towards main thread service first).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for extensive querying of `LoggedSet`, `ActiveProgramInstance`, `ProgramDefinition`, `UserBodyweightLog`, and updating `UserGoal`.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserGoal` (read and update `currentValue`, `status`).
  * `LoggedSet` (read for e1RM).
  * `ActiveProgramInstance` (read for program completion).
  * `UserBodyweightLog` (read for bodyweight goals).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * e1RM calculation logic (`determineRelevantSetsForE1RM`) needs to be well-defined to pick appropriate sets (e.g., not warmups, typically 1-10 reps).
  * Progress calculation functions should be pure where possible and thoroughly unit-tested.
  * If moving to a worker, ensure data serialization and Comlink communication are handled correctly.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **(Engine Infrastructure - Defer Worker Setup):** Based on `FRZ Implementation Plan.md`, initial implementation will be in main-thread services. Worker setup (TS-11, TS-12 for FRZ) is deferred unless profiling proves immediate necessity.
* [ ] Implement the Epley e1RM calculation utility function (`calculateEpleyE1RM`) in `frzCalculations.ts`.
* [ ] Implement `determineRelevantSetsForE1RM` in `frzCalculations.ts` to filter `LoggedSet` data for e1RM calculation.
* [ ] Implement logic in `frzService.ts` (or `frzProgramGoalLogic.ts`) to calculate progress for "Program Completion" goals by querying `ActiveProgramInstance` and `ProgramDefinition` from Dexie.js.
* [ ] Implement logic in `frzService.ts` (or `frzBodyweightGoalLogic.ts`) to calculate progress for "Bodyweight Target" goals by querying `UserBodyweightLog` from Dexie.js.
* [ ] Implement the main service function `calculateAllActiveGoalProgress` in `frzService.ts` that iterates active goals, calls the appropriate progress calculation logic based on goal type, and updates the `currentValue` (and potentially `status` if achieved) of the `UserGoal` entity in Dexie.js.
* [ ] Determine and implement the trigger for `calculateAllActiveGoalProgress` (e.g., after workout save, after bodyweight log save, on app load, or when goal views are accessed). For V1.0, calling it after relevant data saves is a good start.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRZ testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test `calculateEpleyE1RM` with various inputs.
  * Test `determineRelevantSetsForE1RM` with different `LoggedSet` arrays.
  * Test progress calculation logic for each goal type with mocked Dexie.js data.
  * Test `calculateAllActiveGoalProgress` orchestration (mocking underlying calc functions).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest):**
  * With a seeded Dexie.js state, call `calculateAllActiveGoalProgress` and verify that `UserGoal` records are updated correctly with progress values and statuses.
  * Test that new workout logs or bodyweight entries trigger progress recalculation and updates.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Define a goal -> Log relevant data (workouts/bodyweight) -> View goal list/details (Story 5.2/5.4) -> Verify progress is updated and displayed accurately.
  * Test all three goal types.
* **Performance Testing (Manual/DevTools):**
  * Profile `calculateAllActiveGoalProgress` with a large amount of historical workout data and many active goals to assess if main thread execution is acceptable for V1.0 or if worker offloading is needed.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRZ testplan.md` for details)_
