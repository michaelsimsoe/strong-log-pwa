# Story 2.3: Logging Reps for Time (Utilizing Integrated Workout Timer)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log a "Reps for Time" set by specifying the weight, a target number of repetitions, and then using a precise and user-friendly integrated timer (as a stopwatch) to record the time taken to complete them.

**Context:** This story adds support for "Reps for Time" sets, where the goal is to complete a certain number of reps as quickly as possible. It also relies on the Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6), but used in stopwatch mode.

## Detailed Requirements

* Allow a set to be designated as "Reps for Time".
* User must be able to input `weight` used.
* User must be able to input the `target number of repetitions`.
* The **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** shall be used in stopwatch (count-up) mode to measure the `time taken`.
* User must be able to record the `time taken` from the stopwatch upon completion of reps.
* The system should store this set clearly identified as "Reps for Time".
* The data structure for this set type (as defined in `docs/data-models.md`) must be validated using its corresponding **Zod schema** before being saved to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can select "Reps for Time" as a set type.
* AC2: User can input and save weight and target repetitions.
* AC3: The **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** is invoked for this set, configured in stopwatch (count-up) mode.
* AC4: User can easily start the stopwatch when beginning reps and stop it upon completion.
* AC5: The elapsed time from the stopwatch is captured and saved for the set.
* AC6: The saved log accurately reflects the set as "Reps for Time" with weight, target reps, and time taken, and this data passes Zod validation upon saving.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * `src/features/logging/components/SetInputRow.tsx` (or similar).
    * `src/features/logging/hooks/useActiveWorkout.ts`.
    * `src/services/data/workoutService.ts`.
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (ensure `RepsForTimeSet` interface and Zod schema from `docs/data-models.md`).
    * `src/features/logging/components/IntegratedWorkoutTimer.tsx` (from Story 2.6).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` & `docs/data-models.md` for `LoggedSet` union and `RepsForTimeSet` details)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript (as per previous stories).
  * Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6 functionality).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for saving `LoggedSet` with `setType: 'repsForTime'`.
  * API of the Integrated Workout Timer component (from Story 2.6) to start/stop stopwatch.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `LoggedSet` union type, specifically the `RepsForTimeSet` interface:

        ```typescript
        export interface RepsForTimeSet extends BaseSet {
          setType: 'repsForTime';
          targetWeightKg?: number; // Planned weight
          targetReps: number;     // Planned reps
          loggedWeightKg: number;
          loggedReps?: number; // Actual reps if different (e.g. failed target)
          loggedTimeTakenSecs: number; // Time taken to complete targetReps
        }
        ```

  * Corresponding Zod schema for `RepsForTimeSet`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Integration with Timer component (Story 2.6) is key.
  * Zod schema should validate `targetReps` and `loggedTimeTakenSecs`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI in `SetInputRow.tsx` (or equivalent) for "Reps for Time" set type, including inputs for weight, target reps, and display for time taken.
* [ ] Integrate controls to invoke and use the **Integrated Workout Timer (Story 2.6)** in stopwatch mode.
* [ ] Update active workout state management for `RepsForTimeSet` data.
* [ ] Ensure `RepsForTimeSet` interface and Zod schema are correctly defined as per `docs/data-models.md`.
* [ ] Modify `workoutService.ts` to save `LoggedSet` objects with `setType: 'repsForTime'`, applying Zod validation.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. This story heavily depends on Story 2.6 (Timer).

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test UI components for "Reps for Time" set logging: Input fields, interaction with a mocked Timer.
  * Test Zod schema for `RepsForTimeSet`.
  * Test `workoutService.ts` saving logic.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test interaction between logging UI, (mocked or partially real) Timer in stopwatch mode, and saving data to Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Start workout, add exercise, log "Reps for Time" set, use stopwatch, input time, finish workout. Verify data in history (when Epic 6.4 is done).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
