# Story 1.3: Anonymous User Access & Basic Settings with UI Foundation

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to use the app's core logging features immediately without needing to create an account, and configure basic settings like units and theme, so that I can evaluate its usefulness quickly and my data remains local by default.

**Context:** This story focuses on immediate usability for new users by providing anonymous access and foundational UI settings. It establishes the core app layout, styling, and initial component library integration, along with state management for user preferences.

## Detailed Requirements

- The app must be fully functional for workout logging and viewing local data without requiring user registration or login.
- All data for anonymous users must be stored exclusively in their browser's IndexedDB.
- The initial UI foundation, including **Tailwind CSS configuration and base theme setup** (colors, fonts), must be established.
- Core **application layout components** (e.g., `PageWrapper`, basic `Navbar` if applicable for settings access) must be implemented.
- Initial setup of **`shadcn/ui`** should be done, and basic components required for the settings UI (e.g., buttons, select inputs for units/theme) should be added and configured.
- Implement a basic settings area where users can set their preferred units (kg/lbs) and theme (Light/Dark/System). These settings must persist locally in the `userSettings` Dexie.js store and be managed via a Zustand store for UI reactivity.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: On first launch, the user can access core app functionality without encountering a login/signup wall.
- AC2: Data logged by an anonymous user is saved to IndexedDB and is retrievable in subsequent sessions (logging itself is Story 1.5, this AC confirms anonymous context works).
- AC3: User can navigate to a settings screen built with `shadcn/ui` components and core layout.
- AC4: User can select preferred units (kg/lbs) and theme (Light/Dark/System); choices are saved to Dexie.js via Zustand store actions and reflected in the app.
- AC5: Tailwind CSS is configured and basic application theme (colors, fonts) is applied.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `tailwind.config.cjs`, `src/styles/global.css` (or similar for Tailwind setup)
    - `src/components/layout/PageWrapper.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` (or similar core layout)
    - `src/components/ui/` (for `shadcn/ui` components like `Button.tsx`, `Select.tsx`, `Label.tsx`)
    - `src/features/settings/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` (or similar for settings UI)
    - `src/state/uiStore.ts` (or `userSettingsStore.ts` for Zustand store managing theme, units)
    - `src/services/data/db.ts` (to interact with `userSettings` table)
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout & `docs/architecture.md` for UI tech choices)_

- **Key Technologies:**

  - React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  - Tailwind CSS: `~3.4.x`
  - `shadcn/ui`: `latest` (via CLI)
  - Zustand: `~4.5.x`
  - Dexie.js: (from Story 1.2)
  - TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - Zustand API for store creation and hook usage (`create`, `useStore`).
  - Dexie.js API for reading/writing `UserSettings` (from Story 1.2).
  - `shadcn/ui` CLI for adding components.

- **Data Structures:**

  - `UserSettings` interface and Zod schema (from Story 1.2 and `docs/data-models.md`).
  - State structure for Zustand store (e.g., `{ preferredWeightUnit: 'kg' | 'lbs', theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system' }`).

- **Environment Variables:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Component structure for `shadcn/ui` (keep them in `src/components/ui/`).
  - Follow React functional component and hooks best practices.
  - Zustand store organization (e.g., actions within the store definition).
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Design app flow for default anonymous access (ensure no auth checks block core features initially).
- [x] **(UI Foundation):** Configure Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `src/styles/global.css` importing Tailwind directives) and define the base application theme (colors, fonts in Tailwind config).
- [x] **(UI Foundation):** Implement core layout components (e.g., `PageWrapper` for consistent page structure, a basic `Navbar` or `Header` for navigation to settings if needed).
- [x] **(UI Foundation):** Initialize `shadcn/ui` in the project (`npx shadcn-ui@latest init`). Add initial necessary UI components like `Button`, `Select`, `Label`, `RadioGroup` for the settings page using the `shadcn-ui` CLI.
- [x] Implement the UI for the settings screen/page (moved from `src/features/settings/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` to `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`) allowing selection of preferred units (kg/lbs) and theme (Light/Dark/System) using the imported `shadcn/ui` components.
- [x] Create a Zustand store (`src/state/userSettingsStore.ts`) to manage the reactive state for `preferredWeightUnit` and `theme`. This store initializes its state from Dexie.js on load.
- [x] Implement actions in the Zustand store to update these settings. These actions also persist the changes to the `userSettings` table in Dexie.js (using services from Story 1.2) and ensure Zod validation.
- [x] Implement logic to apply the selected theme (by adding/removing a class like 'dark' on the `<html>` element, managed by the Zustand store and Tailwind's dark mode variant).
- [x] Ensure the selected unit preference is accessible globally (via the Zustand store) for other components to use.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  - Test SettingsPage component: Ensure it renders correctly, selects call appropriate Zustand store actions on user interaction.
  - Test Zustand store: Verify actions correctly update state and call Dexie.js persistence logic (mock Dexie calls).
  - Test layout components for basic rendering.
- **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  - Test the flow of changing a setting in the UI, verifying the Zustand store updates, and Dexie.js is written to correctly (can use a real Dexie instance for this specific test if carefully managed).
  - Test that theme changes are reflected in the rendered component tree (e.g., a class is applied).
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Navigate to settings, change unit and theme, reload app, verify settings persist and are applied.
  - Verify anonymous access allows navigation to core features (once logging is implemented).
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Manually verify theme switching (light/dark/system) and unit preference persistence across sessions by inspecting UI and IndexedDB.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
