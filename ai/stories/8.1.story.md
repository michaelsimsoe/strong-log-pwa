# Story 8.1: User Settings Implementation

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated settings area where I can configure my preferences for units, app theme, manage my optional sync account, and access data management options, so I can tailor the app to my needs.

**Context:** This story implements the consolidated user settings screen, allowing users to customize their application experience and manage account/data-related functionalities. It centralizes various preferences and links to features developed in other epics (e.g., Data Management from Epic 7, Timer default from Epic 2).

## Detailed Requirements

* Implement a consolidated "Settings" screen accessible from main navigation.
* **Unit Preference:** Allow users to select their preferred units for weight (kg/lbs). This choice must be reflected consistently across the app (e.g., in workout logging, history display, analytics).
* **Theme Selection:** Provide options for app themes (e.g., Light Mode, Dark Mode, System Default). The selected theme must be applied globally and persist.
* **Sync Account Management:**
  * If not logged in, provide options to create an account or log in for cloud sync (linking to UIs from Epic 7.6).
  * If logged in, display account information (e.g., email) and an option to log out.
  * Display current sync status (e.g., "Syncing...", "Last synced: ...", "Sync Off") and allow users to enable/disable sync if they have an account (toggling `UserSettings.syncEnabled`).
* **Data Management Links:** Provide clear access points for "Export All Data," "Import StrongLifts Data," and "Delete Data" functionalities (developed in Epic 7).
* **Rest Timer Default:** Allow users to set their default rest duration for the Integrated Workout Timer (from Epic 2, Story 2.6). This value will be stored in `UserSettings`.
* User settings data (as defined in `docs/data-models.md` for `UserSettings`) must be validated using a **Zod schema** before being saved to Dexie.js.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can access a dedicated settings screen from the main application navigation.
* AC2: User can select and save their preferred weight units (kg/lbs) in settings; this choice is reflected in relevant data displays and input fields throughout the app and validated by Zod.
* AC3: User can select and apply an app theme (Light/Dark/System); the theme persists across sessions and is Zod-validated on save.
* AC4: User can manage their sync account: view login/create account options if not authenticated, or view account email & logout option if authenticated. User can toggle their sync preference (`UserSettings.syncEnabled`), which is Zod-validated and saved.
* AC5: Links/buttons to "Export All Data," "Import StrongLifts Data," and "Delete Data" functionalities are present in settings and navigate to the correct sections/pages (from Epic 7).
* AC6: User can set and save a default rest duration (e.g., in seconds) for the workout timer, which is validated by Zod. This value is then used by the timer in Epic 2.6.
* AC7: All settings changes are validated using the `UserSettings` Zod schema before being persisted to Dexie.js.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/settings/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/settings/components/UnitPreferenceSetting.tsx`
    * `src/features/settings/components/ThemeSetting.tsx`
    * `src/features/settings/components/SyncAccountManagementSetting.tsx`
    * `src/features/settings/components/DataManagementLinks.tsx`
    * `src/features/settings/components/DefaultRestTimerSetting.tsx`
    * `src/services/data/userSettingsService.ts` (or extend existing service for `UserSettings` CRUD).
    * `src/state/userSettingsStore.ts` (from Epic 1.3, ensure it handles all settings reactively).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Update `UserSettings` interface and Zod schema to include all fields: `preferredWeightUnit`, `theme`, `defaultRestTimerSecs`, `syncEnabled`, `userId`, `authToken`).
    * UI components from Epic 7 for Auth and Data Management (to link to).
    * Integrated Workout Timer logic (Epic 2.6) to consume default rest time.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. `docs/data-models.md` for `UserSettings` structure.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Select`, `Switch`, `Input`, `Button`), Zod, Dexie.js & `dexie-react-hooks`, TypeScript.
  * Zustand (for managing reactive settings state in UI).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API to save and retrieve `UserSettings`.
  * Zustand API for state management.
  * Logic to apply theme changes (e.g., updating class on `<html>` or `<body>` element).

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserSettings` interface and Zod schema, including all fields: `preferredWeightUnit`, `theme`, `defaultRestTimerSecs`, `syncEnabled` (from Epic 7.6), `userId` (from Epic 7.6), etc.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Ensure settings changes are persisted immediately or via an explicit "Save" button, with clear feedback.
  * Unit preference should trigger appropriate data conversion or display formatting where weights are shown/input.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design the UI for the consolidated `SettingsPage.tsx`, organizing different setting categories.
* [ ] Finalize/confirm the `UserSettings` interface and its Zod schema in `src/types/data.types.ts` to include all required fields (`preferredWeightUnit`, `theme`, `syncEnabled`, `userId`, `authToken` handling, `defaultRestTimerSecs`).
* [ ] Implement UI and logic for `UnitPreferenceSetting.tsx` (kg/lbs selection), saving to `UserSettings` via a service that uses Zod validation. Ensure this preference is accessible globally (e.g., via `userSettingsStore`) for other parts of the app.
* [ ] Implement UI and logic for `ThemeSetting.tsx` (Light/Dark/System options), including applying the theme globally and persisting the choice in `UserSettings`.
* [ ] Implement `SyncAccountManagementSetting.tsx`:
  * Display login/create account buttons (linking to Epic 7.6 UIs) if user is not authenticated.
  * If authenticated, display user email, logout button, sync status, and a toggle to enable/disable `UserSettings.syncEnabled`.
* [ ] Implement `DataManagementLinks.tsx` with navigation buttons to "Export All Data" (Story 7.4), "Import StrongLifts Data" (Story 7.1), and "Delete Data" (Story 7.8) pages.
* [ ] Implement `DefaultRestTimerSetting.tsx` allowing users to input and save their preferred default rest duration (in seconds) to `UserSettings.defaultRestTimerSecs`.
* [ ] Ensure all settings save operations utilize a service that performs Zod validation against the `UserSettings` schema.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test each settings sub-component (`UnitPreferenceSetting`, `ThemeSetting`, etc.) for UI interaction and calls to (mocked) saving logic.
  * Test Zod schema for `UserSettings` with various valid/invalid inputs for all fields.
  * Test `userSettingsService.ts` for saving settings with Zod validation.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test interaction between settings components, Zustand store, and Dexie.js (mocked or in-memory) for saving and retrieving settings.
  * Verify theme change applies class to document body.
  * Verify unit preference is correctly stored and can be read.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Navigate to Settings -> Change weight unit -> Go to workout logging, verify new unit is default.
  * Change theme -> Verify theme applies and persists after reload.
  * Manage sync account (test login/logout from here, toggle sync - requires mock backend or existing setup from Epic 7).
  * Click data management links -> verify navigation to correct pages.
  * Set default rest timer -> Start a workout -> Go to rest -> Verify new default is used by timer (Epic 2.6).
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
