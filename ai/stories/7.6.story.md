# Story 7.6: Optional Cloud Sync - Account Creation & Opt-In for Sync

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user who wants to back up my data and potentially use StrongLog on multiple devices in the future, I want to be able to create an optional account and explicitly opt-in to cloud synchronization.

**Context:** This story introduces the user-facing aspects of the optional cloud sync feature: account creation and the explicit opt-in process. It's the gateway to data synchronization (Story 7.7). The backend for this is TBD but the client needs to implement its side of the interaction against a defined API contract.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a clear option for users to create an account (e.g., email/password based, or social login if decided post-V1.0). For V1.0, assume email/password.
* During or after account creation, the user must be explicitly asked if they want to enable cloud synchronization. Opt-in is mandatory.
* Clearly explain what data will be synced (all V1.0 data) and the benefits (backup, multi-device access eventually).
* Store user's sync preference securely (locally in `UserSettings.syncEnabled: boolean` or similar).
* Client-side validation (using Zod) for account creation fields (e.g., email format, password complexity if defined) before submitting to the backend.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can navigate to an account creation screen (e.g., from Settings).
* AC2: User can attempt to create an account by providing necessary credentials (e.g., email, password). Client-side Zod validation is performed on these inputs.
* AC3: After successful account creation (mocked success from backend for now, or basic endpoint), user is presented with a clear opt-in choice for enabling cloud sync, with explanatory text.
* AC4: Cloud sync is disabled by default and only enabled upon explicit user consent.
* AC5: User's choice regarding sync opt-in is saved locally (e.g., in `UserSettings` in Dexie.js).

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/auth/pages/CreateAccountPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/auth/components/CreateAccountForm.tsx`
    * `src/features/auth/components/SyncOptInPrompt.tsx`
    * `src/services/auth/authService.ts` (client-side service to interact with backend auth endpoints).
    * `src/types/auth.types.ts` (Zod schemas for auth request/response payloads).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Update `UserSettings` Zod schema and interface to include `syncEnabled` and potentially `userId`, `authToken`).
    * `src/services/apiClient.ts` (from TS-16, or a basic version here for auth calls).
  * Files to Reference:
    * `docs/api-reference.md` (for backend auth API endpoint definitions like POST `/users` or `/auth/register`).
    * `docs/data-models.md` (update `UserSettings`).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Zod, TypeScript.
  * Fetch API or a library like Axios (if decided for `apiClient.ts`) for backend communication. (Tech stack does not list Axios, assume Fetch API).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * HTTP POST request to backend `/auth/register` (or similar) endpoint, as defined in `docs/api-reference.md`.
  * Store auth token received from backend securely (e.g., in memory, or carefully in `localStorage` if HttpOnly cookies not used for PWA context). For V1.0, auth token handling needs careful consideration for security.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Request payload for account creation (e.g., `{ email: string, password: string }`).
  * Response payload from backend (e.g., `{ userId: string, token: string }` or error).
  * Zod schemas for these payloads.
  * `UserSettings` updated with `syncEnabled: boolean`, `userId?: string`, `authToken?: string` (secure storage of token is key).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (from `docs/environment-vars.md`) for `apiClient.ts`.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Client-side password handling: Do not store raw passwords locally after submission.
  * Securely manage authentication tokens. For PWAs, this can be complex. Options include in-memory (lost on full close), or `localStorage` (XSS risk if not careful). `HttpOnly` cookies are ideal but may have PWA nuances. For V1.0, document chosen strategy and its implications.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for security best practices)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for account creation (email, password, confirm password fields) and the sync opt-in prompt.
* [ ] Define Zod schemas for account creation request payloads (e.g., valid email format, password minimum length/complexity if any).
* [ ] Implement `CreateAccountForm.tsx` with client-side Zod validation.
* [ ] Implement `authService.ts` with a `createAccount(credentials)` function that:
  * Makes an API call to the backend registration endpoint (defined in `docs/api-reference.md`).
  * Handles success (e.g., storing auth token securely, updating user state) and error responses.
* [ ] Implement `SyncOptInPrompt.tsx` displayed after successful account creation.
* [ ] Update `UserSettings` data model and Zod schema to include `syncEnabled` (boolean, defaults to false), `userId` (string, optional), `authToken` (string, optional, with notes on secure storage).
* [ ] Upon user opting into sync, update `UserSettings.syncEnabled` to `true` in Dexie.js.
* [ ] (Backend Task Placeholder) Define and implement the backend API endpoint for user account creation (e.g., POST `/api/v1/users` or `/auth/register`). This story primarily focuses on client implementation against the contract.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `CreateAccountForm.tsx` and `SyncOptInPrompt.tsx` for UI logic, validation messages (mock `authService`).
  * Test Zod schemas for account creation payloads.
  * Test `authService.createAccount` (mock `Workspace` or API client calls) for request formation and response handling.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test the flow: Fill form -> submit -> (mock successful backend response) -> see opt-in prompt -> opt-in -> verify `UserSettings.syncEnabled` is true in Dexie.js.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Navigate to create account -> Enter valid details -> Submit -> (Requires a mock backend or a live dev backend that implements the registration endpoint) -> Verify opt-in prompt appears -> Accept sync. Check `UserSettings` in Dexie via dev tools.
  * Test client-side validation errors for account creation form.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach. Backend endpoint mocking or a live dev version will be crucial for E2E.)_
