# Story 7.7: Optional Cloud Sync - Synchronization Logic for V1.0 Data

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user who has opted into cloud sync, I want all my StrongLog V1.0 data (workouts, exercises, rules, programs, goals, settings) to be securely and reliably synchronized with a cloud backend, using a "last write wins" strategy, so my data is backed up and eventually accessible across devices.

**Context:** This is the core implementation of the data synchronization mechanism. It involves creating client-side services to communicate with the backend API (defined in `docs/api-reference.md`), manage data changes, handle conflicts, and ensure data consistency between local Dexie.js and the cloud.

## Detailed Requirements

* If sync is enabled (from Story 7.6), implement logic to synchronize all V1.0 data entities with a secure cloud backend. Entities include: `UserSettings`, `ExerciseDefinition`, `WorkoutLog` (and `LoggedSet`s), `WorkoutTemplate` (and instances), `ProgramDefinition`, `ActiveProgramInstance`, `ProgressionRule`, `UserGoal`, `UserBodyweightLog`, `AppliedProgressionLog`.
* A dedicated **API Client Service** (Task TS-16) must be developed on the client-side to encapsulate all communication with the backend REST API (defined in `docs/api-reference.md`). This service will handle request formation, sending requests (with auth token), and initial response processing.
* A **Sync Orchestration Service** (Task TS-17) must be developed on the client-side. This service will manage the overall synchronization process, including:
  * Detecting local changes in Dexie.js (new, updated, soft-deleted records) since the last successful push for each entity type.
  * Fetching remote changes from the server via the API Client Service since the last successful pull for each entity type.
  * Applying the 'last write wins' conflict resolution strategy based on `clientUpdatedAt` timestamps when merging server changes or handling server responses to client pushes. The server may use its own `serverUpdatedAt` for tie-breaking or as the authoritative source if merging server data.
  * Managing sync timestamps (e.g., `lastSuccessfulServerSyncTimestamp`, `lastSuccessfulClientPushTimestamp` stored locally, perhaps per-entity or globally).
* Synchronization should occur automatically in the background when network connectivity is available and user is authenticated.
* All data payloads exchanged with the backend API (both sent and received) must be validated on the client-side using **Zod schemas** derived from the API contract (`docs/api-reference.md`) and local data models (`docs/data-models.md`).
* Ensure data is transmitted securely (HTTPS).
* Sync operations, especially background checks or processes involving significant data transfer/processing, should be managed to minimize impact on the main thread. This might involve offloading parts of the sync orchestration or data preparation/merging logic to a **Web Worker** if found to be blocking, or using careful scheduling for background tasks (e.g., using `requestIdleCallback` or debouncing).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: When sync is enabled and network is available, new and updated local data for all V1.0 entities is automatically detected and pushed to the cloud via the API Client and Sync Orchestration services. Payloads are Zod-validated.
* AC2: Data changes from the cloud for all V1.0 entities are fetched and merged into local Dexie.js correctly, applying the "last write wins" conflict resolution based on timestamps. Fetched payloads are Zod-validated.
* AC3: Data created or modified offline is successfully queued and synced when connectivity resumes.
* AC4: Soft deletes (records marked `isDeleted: true`) are synced to the server (and vice-versa if applicable), effectively removing them from active views on other devices.
* AC5: Sync process correctly manages and updates local sync timestamps upon successful operations.
* AC6: (If worker offload implemented) Sync operations do not noticeably block the main UI thread.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/services/sync/apiClient.ts` (TS-16: Implements calls to all REST endpoints from `docs/api-reference.md`).
    * `src/services/sync/syncOrchestrator.ts` (TS-17: Core sync logic, change detection, merge, conflict resolution).
    * `src/services/sync/sync.worker.ts` (Optional: if offloading parts of sync logic).
    * `src/types/api.types.ts` (Zod schemas for all API request/response payloads).
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Ensure local models have `clientUpdatedAt`, `isDeleted`, and potentially `serverId` fields).
  * _(Hint: `docs/api-reference.md` defines the backend contract. `docs/data-models.md` needs to support sync fields.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * TypeScript, Dexie.js (for change tracking if not using its hooks directly, or for querying records needing sync).
  * Zod (for API payload validation).
  * Fetch API (within `apiClient.ts`).
  * Potentially Shared Web Workers & Comlink.
  * Browser Network Information API (`navigator.onLine`) for connectivity checks.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * `apiClient.ts` will use Fetch API to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to all endpoints defined in `docs/api-reference.md` (e.g., `GET /api/v1/workout-logs?since={ts}`, `POST /api/v1/workout-logs/batch`).
  * `syncOrchestrator.ts` will use `apiClient.ts`.
  * Dexie.js for local CRUD and querying records changed since last sync. `Table.hook('updating')` and `creating` could be used for simple change detection or a more explicit "dirty records" table.

* **Data Structures:**
  * Local data models extended with sync-related fields: `id` (client UUID), `clientCreatedAt`, `clientUpdatedAt`, `isDeleted`, `serverId` (optional, server's ID for the record).
  * API request/response payloads as defined by Zod schemas in `api.types.ts`, aligning with `docs/api-reference.md`.
  * Local storage for `lastSuccessfulServerSyncTimestamp` and `lastSuccessfulClientPushTimestamp` (perhaps in `UserSettings` or a dedicated Dexie table).

* **Environment Variables:**
  * `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Sync logic must be resilient to network errors and backend failures (e.g., implement retries with backoff in `apiClient.ts` or `syncOrchestrator.ts`).
  * "Last write wins": compare `clientUpdatedAt` of local record with `clientUpdatedAt` of incoming server record. If pushing, server might also do this check.
  * Ensure Zod validation is strictly applied to all data entering/leaving the client via API.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md`, especially error handling and security sections)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] **Update Data Models:** Add necessary sync fields (`clientUpdatedAt`, `isDeleted`, `serverId?`) to all relevant Dexie.js table schemas and TypeScript interfaces in `docs/data-models.md` and `src/types/data.types.ts`. Update Zod schemas accordingly.
* [ ] **(TS-16) API Client Service:** Implement `apiClient.ts` with functions for each REST endpoint defined in `docs/api-reference.md` (e.g., `getUpdates(entity, since)`, `pushUpdates(entity, records)`). Include request/response Zod validation and auth token handling.
* [ ] **Define Zod Schemas for API Payloads:** Create Zod schemas in `src/types/api.types.ts` for all request and response bodies for sync operations, based on `docs/api-reference.md`.
* [ ] **(TS-17) Sync Orchestration Service - Change Detection:** Implement logic in `syncOrchestrator.ts` to detect local changes (new, updated, soft-deleted records) in Dexie.js tables since the last successful push. This might involve querying records with `clientUpdatedAt > lastPushTimestamp`.
* [ ] **(TS-17) Sync Orchestration Service - Fetch & Merge Remote Changes:** Implement logic to fetch remote changes using `apiClient.ts` and merge them into local Dexie.js, applying "last write wins" conflict resolution based on `clientUpdatedAt`. Validate incoming data with Zod.
* [ ] **(TS-17) Sync Orchestration Service - Push Local Changes:** Implement logic to batch and push local changes to the server using `apiClient.ts`. Handle server responses and update local records if necessary (e.g., with `serverId`).
* [ ] **(TS-17) Sync Orchestration Service - Timestamp Management:** Manage `lastSuccessfulServerSyncTimestamp` and `lastSuccessfulClientPushTimestamp` locally.
* [ ] **Background Sync Trigger:** Implement logic to trigger sync automatically when online and authenticated (e.g., on app load, periodically, on network status change).
* [ ] **(Backend Task Placeholder)** Develop all backend API endpoints as per `docs/api-reference.md` to handle these sync operations.
* [ ] **Performance Profiling & Worker Offload (Optional for V1.0):** Profile sync operations. If UI blocking occurs with large datasets, refactor intensive parts (e.g., large data merging, batch preparation) into `sync.worker.ts`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test `apiClient.ts` functions (mock `Workspace`). Test Zod validation of mock API responses/requests.
  * Test `syncOrchestrator.ts` modules: local change detection logic (mock Dexie), merge logic, conflict resolution, timestamp updates.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test `syncOrchestrator.ts` interaction with a mocked `apiClient.ts` and a real (in-memory) Dexie.js instance.
  * Simulate scenarios: local changes only, remote changes only, concurrent changes with conflicts.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright with Mock Backend):**
  * Critical for sync. Use a mock backend (e.g., Mock Service Worker - MSW, not in tech stack but essential for this) to simulate API responses.
  * Scenario 1: Opt-into sync. Create data locally -> verify it's pushed to mock backend.
  * Scenario 2: Mock backend has new data -> trigger sync -> verify data appears in local Dexie.js and UI.
  * Scenario 3: Offline changes -> go online -> verify sync.
  * Scenario 4: Conflict: local update vs. remote update to same record -> verify "last write wins".
  * Scenario 5: Soft delete sync.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md`. Mocking the backend API robustly is key for E2E testing of sync.)_
