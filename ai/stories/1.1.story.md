# Story 1.1: PWA Initialization and Installability

**Status:** Review

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to access StrongLog via a web browser and install it on my mobile device as a PWA, so that I can have a native-like app experience with offline access.

**Context:** This is the foundational story for the StrongLog PWA. It establishes the core project setup, PWA capabilities, development tooling, and basic error handling, enabling a native-like, installable application experience with offline access. This story sets the stage for all subsequent development.

## Detailed Requirements

- The application must be a Progressive Web App, meeting PWA checklist criteria (e.g., HTTPS, service worker, web app manifest).
- The project must be initialized using **Vite with the React TypeScript template**.
- **ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig** must be configured to enforce consistent code style and quality from the outset.
- **Git hooks using Husky and lint-staged** must be set up to automate linting and formatting on pre-commit.
- The root `tsconfig.json` must be configured with **TypeScript strict mode options** enabled.
- Implement a `manifest.json` file with appropriate app name (StrongLog), icons, start URL, display mode (standalone), and theme colors. The `manifest.json` must be comprehensive, including `short_name`, `description`, a full range of icon sizes, `theme_color`, `background_color`, `display_override: ['standalone', 'minimal-ui']`, and appropriate `scope` and `start_url` for optimal PWA behavior.
- Implement a service worker to manage caching of the app shell and essential static assets for offline launch and performance. The service worker (managed by `vite-plugin-pwa` using Workbox) should implement **robust app shell caching** and basic asset caching strategies.
- The PWA should prompt users on supported browsers/platforms to "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App".
- A **global error handling strategy**, including React Error Boundaries for UI sections and a basic client-side logging approach (e.g., to console, with context), needs to be established.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The application is served over HTTPS.
- AC2: A valid `manifest.json` is configured with all specified comprehensive properties, allowing the app to be added to the home screen on Android and iOS (via Safari).
- AC3: A service worker, configured via `vite-plugin-pwa` and Workbox, is registered and successfully caches the app shell and essential assets.
- AC4: The app can be launched from the home screen icon and opens in a standalone window (without browser chrome).
- AC5: The app loads and displays its basic shell even when the device is offline (after initial load and caching).
- AC6: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged are configured and functional.
- AC7: Basic React Error Boundaries are implemented for main application sections.
- AC8: Initial testing infrastructure (Vitest, Playwright) is configured.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**

  - Files to Create/Modify:
    - `vite.config.ts` (for `vite-plugin-pwa` and Vitest config)
    - `public/manifest.json`
    - `public/icons/` (various icon sizes)
    - `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc.cjs`, `.editorconfig`
    - `.husky/pre-commit`, `.lintstagedrc.cjs`
    - `tsconfig.json` (ensure strict mode)
    - `src/App.tsx` (implement Error Boundaries)
    - `src/main.tsx` (PWA setup if needed)
    - `tests/setup/vitest.setup.ts` (or similar for Vitest global setup)
    - `playwright.config.ts` (or similar for Playwright setup)
    - Example E2E test file in `tests/e2e/`
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for overall layout)_

- **Key Technologies:**

  - Vite: `~5.2.x`
  - React: `~18.2.x` or `~18.3.x`
  - TypeScript: `~5.4.x`
  - `vite-plugin-pwa`: `~0.19.x` (with Workbox `~7.x.x`)
  - ESLint: `~8.x.x` or `~9.x.x`
  - Prettier: `~3.x.x`
  - Husky: `~9.x.x`
  - lint-staged: `~15.x.x`
  - Vitest: `~1.5.x`
  - React Testing Library: `~15.0.x`
  - Playwright: `~1.44.x`
  - Node.js (for dev tooling): `^20.11.x` (LTS) or `^22.x.x` (Current)
  - PNPM (package manager): `~9.x.x`
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**

  - N/A for this story.

- **Data Structures:**

  - N/A for this story directly, but PWA manifest is a JSON structure.

- **Environment Variables:**

  - `VITE_APP_NAME` (e.g., "StrongLog") for `manifest.json` if sourced from env.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` for all variables)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Enable and adhere to `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.
  - Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations.
  - Implement basic client-side logging conventions (e.g., using `console.debug/info/warn/error` with context).
  - _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize Vite project with React & TypeScript template.
- [x] Configure ESLint with React/TypeScript plugins & Prettier; define rules in respective config files.
- [x] Setup `.editorconfig` for consistent editor settings.
- [x] Implement Git hooks using Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit linting/formatting.
- [x] Configure `tsconfig.json` for strict type checking.
- [x] Configure hosting with HTTPS (developer note: this is an infrastructure concern, ensure local dev uses HTTPS if possible via Vite config, and deployment target supports HTTPS).
- [x] Create and fine-tune `public/manifest.json` with all required PWA properties (name, short_name, description, icons, start_url, scope, display, theme_color, background_color, display_override).
- [x] Configure `vite-plugin-pwa` in `vite.config.ts` for service worker generation (Workbox strategies for app shell and asset precaching).
- [x] Implement basic React Error Boundaries for main application sections (e.g., around `App.tsx` or major routes).
- [x] Establish initial client-side logging conventions (e.g., a simple wrapper around `console` or guidelines for contextual logging).
- [x] **(Testing Infrastructure Setup):** Install and configure Vitest with React Testing Library; set up initial test configuration files (e.g., `vitest.config.ts` or integrated in `vite.config.ts`, `tests/setup/vitest.setup.ts`).
- [x] **(Testing Infrastructure Setup):** Install and configure Playwright for E2E testing; create initial configuration files and an example E2E test structure.
- [x] Test install prompt, offline launch, and manifest validity on target mobile platforms (Android/Chrome, iOS/Safari).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - N/A directly for PWA setup, but Error Boundary components should have unit tests (using Vitest & RTL) verifying they catch errors and render fallback UI.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - N/A for this story.
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged are working by making changes and committing.
  - Inspect `manifest.json` in browser dev tools.
  - Use browser dev tools (Application tab) to verify service worker registration, caching, and offline capabilities.
  - Test "Add to Home Screen" functionality on Android and iOS.
  - Verify app launches in standalone mode and works offline.
  - Verify HTTPS is enabled on deployed environments.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - Basic E2E test to launch the app and check if the main page loads (can be expanded later).
  - Playwright tests can assert PWA properties or offline status once more UI is in place.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` for the overall approach)_
