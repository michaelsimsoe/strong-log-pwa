# Story 4.7: User Override of Program Schedule / Workout Selection

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the flexibility to deviate from the program's suggested workout or schedule for the day (e.g., by choosing to do Workout C when Workout B was suggested, or by doing an ad-hoc workout) without disrupting my overall program tracking.

**Context:** This story ensures user flexibility within the structured program environment. It allows users to make choices that differ from FRY's suggestions while ensuring the FRY engine adapts gracefully.

## Detailed Requirements

* The UI must allow users to easily choose a workout different from the one suggested by the adaptive scheduler for that day (e.g., pick any workout from any active program, or start an ad-hoc workout).
* If a user performs a program workout out of its suggested sequence (e.g., does Workout C of Program X today, even if Workout B was next on the adaptive schedule), the program state (`ActiveProgramInstance` for Program X, managed by FRY) and adaptive schedule (calculated by FRY) should adjust accordingly for future projections.
* Performing ad-hoc (non-program) workouts should not disrupt the state or schedule of any active programs.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can choose to perform Workout C of an active program even if Workout B was suggested for today by the adaptive scheduler.
* AC2: User can switch between their active programs and log a workout for any of them on any given day, irrespective of the adaptive schedule's primary suggestion.
* AC3: After a user performs an out-of-sequence program workout (e.g., Workout C instead of B), the system correctly updates that program's `ActiveProgramInstance` state (via FRY worker's `logProgramWorkoutCompletion`), and subsequent calls to FRY's `getProgramScheduleView` or `getNextWorkoutPlan` reflect the new reality (e.g., Workout B might still be "next" if not completed, or schedule adapts based on C's completion).
* AC4: Logging an ad-hoc (non-program) workout does not alter the `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram`, `lastCompletedWorkoutDate`, or `carriedOverExercises` of any `ActiveProgramInstance`.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Modify:
    * UI components that display "next suggested workout" (e.g., `src/features/dashboard/components/TodayFocus.tsx`) to also allow Browse/selecting other program workouts or ad-hoc.
    * `src/features/programs/pages/ProgramDetailPage.tsx` (if exists, to allow starting any workout from the program).
    * `src/services/engines/fry.worker.ts` (ensure `logProgramWorkoutCompletion` correctly updates state regardless of whether the logged workout was the "current" one in sequence, it just logs _that specific workout_ for the program).
    * `src/services/engines/fry/fryLogic.ts` (ensure `updateProgramStateOnCompletion` correctly handles the specific `workoutLog` details, and `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` uses the latest `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` from any program workout).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md`. Logic centers on flexible invocation of workout logging and robust state updates in FRY.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui`, Dexie.js, TypeScript, Shared Web Workers, Comlink.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * UI will need to allow users to select any workout from an `ActiveProgramInstance`'s `ProgramDefinition` sequence, get its plan via FRY's `getNextWorkoutPlan` (or a similar method that can generate a plan for a _specific_ workout in the sequence, not just the "next" one).
  * When an ad-hoc workout is logged, ensure no program-related FRY methods are called.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ActiveProgramInstance`: Its state needs to be updated based on the actual workout performed, not just the one that was "next". `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` should reflect the most recent program workout finished, regardless of its order. `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram` might need careful handling: does it always advance, or does it only advance if the "next" one is done? The latter is more complex. For V1.0, perhaps `logProgramWorkoutCompletion` simply records completion of the _specific_ workout logged, and `getNextWorkoutPlan` primarily uses `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram` but `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` uses the _actual_ `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` from any program workout. `Program Management & Adaptive Scheduling Engine (FRY).md` suggests `currentWorkoutInSequenceIndex` advances.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * The main challenge is ensuring FRY's state (`ActiveProgramInstance`) and adaptive schedule remain logical even with out-of-sequence completions.
  * A key decision: If user does Workout C, then Workout B later, how does `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram` behave? `docs/Program Management & Adaptive Scheduling Engine (FRY).md` implies it advances. If so, the schedule has to adapt from the new `lastCompletedWorkoutDate`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI elements that allow users to easily select and start _any_ workout from their active programs, not just the one FRY suggests as "next" via the adaptive schedule. This might involve enhancing the program library or dashboard.
* [ ] Modify the FRY worker's `logProgramWorkoutCompletion` method (and its helper `updateProgramStateOnCompletion` in `fryLogic.ts`) to robustly handle a `workoutLog` that might not correspond to the `ActiveProgramInstance.currentWorkoutOrderInProgram`. It should correctly:
  * Record the specific workout from the program sequence that was completed.
  * Update `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` to the `endTime` of this workout log.
  * Add this workout to the `completedWorkoutHistory` of the `ActiveProgramInstance`.
  * Decide how `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram` is updated (e.g., does it still advance, or does it reflect the "next chronological workout yet to be done"? The former is simpler and more aligned with the FRY document which suggests `currentWorkoutInSequenceIndex` advances).
* [ ] Ensure that the `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` logic in `fryLogic.ts` always uses the true `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` from the `ActiveProgramInstance` (which could be from an out-of-sequence workout) to project future dates.
* [ ] Verify that logging an ad-hoc (non-program related) workout does not call any FRY program update methods and does not affect any `ActiveProgramInstance` data.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRY testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test `updateProgramStateOnCompletion` in FRY worker with scenarios of logging workouts out of sequence. Verify how `currentWorkoutOrderInProgram` and `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` are updated.
  * Test `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` with `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` that reflects an out-of-sequence completion.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest, worker context):**
  * Simulate user logging Program Workout C then Program Workout B. Call FRY worker methods (`logProgramWorkoutCompletion`, `getProgramScheduleView`, `getNextWorkoutPlan`) and verify the state of `ActiveProgramInstance` and the outputs are logical.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Activate a program (e.g., A-B-C).
  * Verify schedule suggests A. User performs A. Schedule suggests B.
  * User explicitly chooses to perform C. Log C. Verify schedule adapts (e.g., still suggests B, or if B is now considered "done" by some logic, suggests next cycle's A, using C's completion date as baseline). This tests the chosen state update strategy.
  * Log an ad-hoc workout. Verify program schedule/state is unchanged.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRY testplan.md` for details)_
