# Story 5.2: Goal Management (View, Edit, Delete Active Goals)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my active goals, edit their details if my objectives change, or delete goals that are no longer relevant, so I can keep my goal list current.

**Context:** Following goal creation (Story 5.1), this story focuses on providing users with the ability to manage their existing goals, including viewing progress, editing, manually marking as achieved, and deleting/archiving.

## Detailed Requirements

* Provide a list view of all active (not yet achieved or archived) goals.
* Each goal in the list should show its name/description, target, and current progress (if calculable at list view level - progress calculation itself is Story 5.3).
* Users must be able to select a goal to:
  * `View` its full details.
  * `Edit` its parameters (e.g., target weight/reps, target date), with changes validated by Zod schemas.
  * `Mark as Achieved` manually (if system hasn't auto-detected).
  * `Delete` or `Archive` the goal (with confirmation). (For V1.0, 'delete' might set status to 'archived' or actually remove record).

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: User can access a list view of all their active goals, fetched reactively from Dexie.js.
* AC2: User can select a goal and view its detailed definition and current progress (progress display depends on Story 5.3).
* AC3: User can edit the parameters of an existing active goal (reusing/adapting UI from Story 5.1), and changes are Zod-validated before saving.
* AC4: User can manually mark an active goal as 'achieved', which updates its status and potentially `achievedDate` in Dexie.js.
* AC5: User can delete or archive an active goal (with confirmation), which updates its status or removes it from Dexie.js based on chosen strategy.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/features/goals/pages/GoalListPage.tsx`
    * `src/features/goals/components/GoalListItem.tsx`
    * `src/features/goals/pages/EditGoalPage.tsx` (or extend `CreateGoalPage.tsx`)
    * `src/features/goals/pages/ViewGoalPage.tsx` (can be part of EditGoalPage or GoalListItem expansion)
    * `src/services/data/goalService.ts` (extend for update, delete/archive, get all/one goal functionalities).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` for feature-based structure.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * React, `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Table` or list, `Button`, `Switch`, `AlertDialog`), Dexie.js, Zod, TypeScript.
  * `dexie-react-hooks` (`useLiveQuery`) for reactive list of goals.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Dexie.js API for CRUD operations on the `userGoals` table.
  * `useLiveQuery` for reactive display of goals.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `UserGoal` interface and Zod schema (from Story 5.1 and `docs/data-models.md`). Fields like `status` and `achievedDate` are important here.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Editing should reuse the validation logic (Zod schemas) from goal creation.
  * Decide on delete vs. archive strategy (soft delete by status vs. hard delete). `docs/data-models.md` suggests `status: 'active' | 'achieved' | 'archived'`.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Design UI for the goals list page, displaying key goal information and actions (View, Edit, Delete/Archive, Mark Achieved).
* [ ] Implement fetching and displaying the list of active `UserGoal` objects from Dexie.js using `useLiveQuery`.
* [ ] Implement UI for viewing full goal details (can reuse parts of creation form in read-only mode).
* [ ] Implement editing functionality, loading existing `UserGoal` data into the form from Story 5.1, and saving Zod-validated changes back to Dexie.js via `goalService.ts`.
* [ ] Implement logic to manually mark a goal as 'achieved' (updating `status` to 'achieved' and setting `achievedDate`).
* [ ] Implement deletion/archiving of a goal (e.g., setting status to 'archived' or actually deleting the record), including a confirmation dialog.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRZ testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test `GoalListPage` and `GoalListItem` components for correct rendering and interactions.
  * Test `EditGoalPage` component for form handling with existing data and validation.
  * Test `goalService.ts` functions for update, delete/archive operations (mock Dexie.js).
* **Integration Tests (Vitest & RTL):**
  * Test creating a goal, then editing it, marking it achieved, and finally deleting/archiving it, verifying Dexie.js state at each step.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * User flow: Create a goal. View it in the list. Edit its target. Manually mark it as achieved. Delete/archive another goal. Verify UI and persistence.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRZ testplan.md` for details)_
