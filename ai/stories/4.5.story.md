# Story 4.5: Adaptive Scheduling Logic & Display (in FRY Worker)

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a user following an active program, I want the system (FRY Engine in a Web Worker) to project a schedule for my upcoming workouts based on my program's target frequency and my actual completion dates, and for this schedule to adapt if I train on different days than projected.

**Context:** This story implements the adaptive scheduling feature within the FRY worker. It calculates and adjusts projected workout dates based on user adherence and program frequency, providing a flexible schedule.

## Detailed Requirements

* The adaptive scheduling calculations will be performed within the **FRY Engine (Shared Web Worker)**.
* The FRY worker projects a date for the next suggested workout based on the program's target frequency (from `ProgramDefinition`) and the completion date of the user's last workout for that program (from `ActiveProgramInstance.lastCompletedWorkoutDate`).
* If a user completes a workout earlier or later than this projected date, the FRY worker recalculates and adapts the projected dates for all subsequent workouts in that program's current cycle/sequence.
* The UI (e.g., on the dashboard or a dedicated program view) must display the upcoming workout(s) and their currently projected (adaptive) dates, fetched from the FRY worker or derived from its state updates to Dexie.js.
* The display should make it clear that these dates are suggestions and can adapt.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

* AC1: The FRY worker's `getProgramScheduleView` method correctly projects a date for the next workout in an active program based on its `targetFrequency` and `lastCompletedWorkoutDate`.
* AC2: If a workout is logged on a day different from a prior projection, subsequent calls to `getProgramScheduleView` (after program state is updated) reflect adjusted projected dates for future workouts in that program.
* AC3: The UI (specific component TBD, e.g., part of Dashboard in Epic 6 or a program detail view) can fetch and clearly display the name and projected date of the next 1-3 upcoming workouts for active programs, reflecting FRY's calculations.
* AC4: The adaptive scheduling logic in the FRY worker correctly handles programs with different frequencies (e.g., 2x/week vs 4x/week, "every X days").

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

* **Relevant Files:**
  * Files to Create/Modify:
    * `src/services/engines/fry.worker.ts` (Implement `getProgramScheduleView`).
    * `src/services/engines/fry/fryLogic.ts` (Implement `calculateAdaptiveSchedule`).
    * UI component(s) to display this schedule (e.g., `src/features/dashboard/components/UpcomingProgramWorkouts.tsx` or `src/features/programs/components/ProgramScheduleView.tsx`).
  * Files to Create/Reference:
    * `src/types/data.types.ts` (Define `ProgramScheduleItem` if not already in `FRY Implementation Plan.md`).
  * _(Hint: `docs/FRY Implementation Plan.md` provides structure for `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` and the `ProgramScheduleItem` output.)_

* **Key Technologies:**
  * Shared Web Workers, Comlink, Dexie.js, TypeScript.
  * Date manipulation libraries (e.g., `date-fns` - if not already decided, consider adding to tech stack, or use native Date methods carefully). (Tech stack does not list one, so assume native Date methods for now unless agent decides a lib is essential).
  * _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` for full list)_

* **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  * Comlink API for main thread to call `getProgramScheduleView` on FRY worker.
  * Dexie.js API for reading `ActiveProgramInstance` and `ProgramDefinition` within the worker.

* **Data Structures:**
  * `ActiveProgramInstance` (specifically `lastCompletedWorkoutDate`).
  * `ProgramDefinition` (specifically `targetFrequency`).
  * `ProgramScheduleItem`: `{ workoutOrderInProgram: number; dayTag?: string; projectedDate: number; }`.

* **Environment Variables:**
  * N/A for this story.

* **Coding Standards Notes:**
  * Scheduling algorithm should be robust and handle edge cases like first workout of a program.
  * Be mindful of time zones if `Date` objects are used directly; Unix timestamps (numbers) are generally safer for internal calculations. `docs/data-models.md` uses `number` for timestamps.
  * _(Hint: See `docs/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Tasks / Subtasks

* [ ] Implement the `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` function in `src/services/engines/fry/fryLogic.ts`. This involves:
  * Taking `ActiveProgramInstance`, `ProgramDefinition`, and `numberOfWorkouts` as input.
  * Using `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` and `targetFrequency` to calculate the projected date for the immediate next workout.
  * Iteratively calculating projected dates for subsequent workouts in the program sequence.
* [ ] Implement the `getProgramScheduleView` method in `fry.worker.ts` which calls `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` and returns an array of `ProgramScheduleItem`.
* [ ] Design and implement a UI component (e.g., in Dashboard or Program views) to call the FRY worker's `getProgramScheduleView` method and display the returned schedule (workout name/tag and projected date).
* [ ] Ensure the adaptive logic correctly recalculates when `lastCompletedWorkoutDate` in `ActiveProgramInstance` is updated (after a workout is logged in Story 4.6).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests. Refer to `docs/FRY testplan.md`.

* **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
  * Test `calculateAdaptiveSchedule` function with various inputs:
    * Different `targetFrequency` types and values.
    * Different `lastCompletedWorkoutDate`s (e.g., recent, long ago, null for new program).
    * Scenarios where user is on schedule, ahead, or behind.
* **Integration Tests (Vitest, worker context):**
  * Test the FRY worker's `getProgramScheduleView` Comlink method. Provide an `activeProgramInstanceId`, ensure worker correctly fetches data from Dexie.js (mocked or simple real) and returns the expected schedule items.
* **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  * Activate a program. Verify initial projected schedule in UI.
  * Log a program workout on a different day than projected. Verify the UI updates to show an adapted schedule for subsequent workouts.
  * Test with different program frequencies.
* _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` and `docs/FRY testplan.md` for details)_
